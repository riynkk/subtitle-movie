00:00:20.270  --> 00:00:24.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dear Sir Sakonji Urokodaki.


00:00:24.000  --> 00:00:26.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How are you?


00:00:26.010  --> 00:00:32.689 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
For me, I was injured after fighting the demons


00:00:32.689  --> 00:00:34.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I am okay.


00:00:34.470  --> 00:00:38.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They treated me with care,
so I'm getting better.


00:00:38.760  --> 00:00:45.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, I'd like to take this opportunity
to tell you what went on.


00:00:45.390  --> 00:00:49.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The outside world
is full of strong demons, indeed.


00:00:49.650  --> 00:00:52.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There was a swamp demon that was
able to split its body into three.


00:00:52.780  --> 00:00:55.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There was a demon that manipulated
temaris and arrows.


00:00:57.660  --> 00:01:00.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There was also a demon that controlled
a whole house with tsuzumis.


00:01:01.410  --> 00:01:07.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't think I could have survived
without your hard training.


00:01:07.080  --> 00:01:10.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And then, I found myself some new friends
from Demon Slayer Corps.


00:01:10.960  --> 00:01:15.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"They are agatsuma zenitsu and hashibira inosuke"


00:01:15.200  --> 00:01:19.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'd like you to meet them someday.


00:01:21.890  --> 00:01:24.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko is still fine too.


00:01:24.140  --> 00:01:28.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going to defeat strong demons


00:01:28.770  --> 00:01:32.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
so that I can find a way to turn
Nezuko back to being human again.


00:01:32.070  --> 00:01:36.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I will work harder for that.


00:01:36.320  --> 00:01:40.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I look forward to seeing you again.


00:01:40.740  --> 00:01:43.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please take care of yourself.


00:01:43.950  --> 00:01:45.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My regards,


00:01:45.580  --> 00:01:48.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro Kamado.


00:01:49.900  --> 00:01:52.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro, what are you doing?


00:01:52.380  --> 00:01:55.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wrote a letter to a person
who had been good to me.


00:01:55.220  --> 00:01:59.759 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now that I'm feeling better,
I thought it's time for a mission.


00:01:59.759  --> 00:02:00.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A mission?


00:02:00.900  --> 00:02:04.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't wanna! I won't go! Please no!


00:02:04.720  --> 00:02:07.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- I won't!
- Zenitsu?


00:02:07.600  --> 00:02:09.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did you say "mission"?


00:02:10.430  --> 00:02:12.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll going to smash them all!


00:02:12.770  --> 00:02:15.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you doing, you stupid boar?!


00:02:15.860  --> 00:02:17.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That makes me hungry!


00:02:17.610  --> 00:02:19.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hungry for battle, right?


00:02:26.040  --> 00:02:29.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
North-northeast! North-northeast!


00:02:29.220  --> 00:02:31.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your next mission is north-northeast!


00:02:31.790  --> 00:02:34.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The three of you are to reach Mount Natagumo!


00:02:34.880  --> 00:02:37.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Head to Mount Natagumo!


00:02:45.770  --> 00:02:47.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We're heading out now.


00:02:47.860  --> 00:02:53.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Always live your lives
with great pride.


00:02:53.610  --> 00:02:56.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wish you luck in battle.


00:03:09.600  --> 00:03:11.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hold up!


00:03:11.000  --> 00:03:13.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Would you mind waiting a second?


00:03:13.380  --> 00:03:16.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Zenitsu, what's wrong?


00:03:16.130  --> 00:03:17.829 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm scared, all right?


00:03:17.829  --> 00:03:21.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now that we're close to our destination,
I'm so scared!


00:03:21.130  --> 00:03:25.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why is he sitting down?
How gross is that?


00:03:25.280  --> 00:03:27.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who are you to talk, Pig Head?


00:03:27.640  --> 00:03:31.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't tell me you're not sensing
anything at all from that mountain!


00:03:39.300  --> 00:03:42.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Still, what good will it do
to just sit there?


00:03:42.560  --> 00:03:44.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I told you, he's gross.


00:03:44.690  --> 00:03:46.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I am not in any way gross!


00:03:46.360  --> 00:03:50.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm normal! I'm the normal one!
You guys are the abnormal ones!


00:03:57.270  --> 00:03:59.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What? What's wrong?


00:03:59.560  --> 00:04:01.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey...


00:04:01.210  --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is this smell?


00:04:03.410  --> 00:04:04.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro!


00:04:04.630  --> 00:04:07.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on!
Don't leave me here by myself!


00:04:07.680  --> 00:04:09.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't leave me!


00:04:22.280  --> 00:04:25.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
H-Help me.


00:04:25.650  --> 00:04:28.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's got our uniform on!
He's a Demon Slayer!


00:04:28.340  --> 00:04:30.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Something must've happened!


00:04:30.550  --> 00:04:32.159 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hold up!


00:04:32.159  --> 00:04:34.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you all right?
What happened?


00:04:39.640  --> 00:04:41.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was still connected too!


00:04:41.460  --> 00:04:45.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Help me!


00:05:01.000  --> 00:05:02.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going.


00:05:05.570  --> 00:05:07.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll head in first.


00:05:07.490  --> 00:05:11.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You can tremble in fear and follow me.


00:05:11.330  --> 00:05:13.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm hungry.


00:05:13.830  --> 00:05:16.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke.


00:05:16.330  --> 00:05:19.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You mean, you're hungry for battle.


00:05:21.170  --> 00:05:22.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here I come!


00:06:36.909  --> 00:06:44.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
"Mount Natagumo Arc"


00:06:57.770  --> 00:06:59.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What the hell is this?


00:07:08.140  --> 00:07:09.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A spider web?


00:07:11.270  --> 00:07:14.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Jeez, this place is full of spider webs!


00:07:14.400  --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're in my way!


00:07:15.810  --> 00:07:17.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're right.


00:07:18.600  --> 00:07:19.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke.


00:07:19.790  --> 00:07:21.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What do you want?


00:07:21.710  --> 00:07:23.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thanks.


00:07:24.290  --> 00:07:28.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
When you said that you'd come with me,
I was glad.


00:07:30.230  --> 00:07:34.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That twisted and ominous scent
I was picking up from the mountain


00:07:34.010  --> 00:07:37.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
made me a little scared.


00:07:37.310  --> 00:07:38.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So thank you.


00:07:42.810  --> 00:07:47.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
These are pleasant to the touch
and quite comfortable.


00:07:47.480  --> 00:07:52.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Always live your lives with great pride.


00:07:52.370  --> 00:07:55.159 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wish you luck in battle.


00:07:58.159  --> 00:08:00.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke.


00:08:04.360  --> 00:08:05.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go.


00:08:14.820  --> 00:08:16.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We've come to help.


00:08:16.500  --> 00:08:19.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm Tanjiro Kamado, Rank Mizunoto.


00:08:19.990  --> 00:08:22.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mizunoto...


00:08:22.000  --> 00:08:24.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mizunoto?


00:08:24.190  --> 00:08:26.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why didn't they send a Hashira?


00:08:26.730  --> 00:08:29.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No matter how many Mizunoto
they send, it won't help!


00:08:29.560  --> 00:08:30.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's pointless!


00:08:32.280  --> 00:08:33.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke!


00:08:33.520  --> 00:08:34.799 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shut up!


00:08:34.799  --> 00:08:40.039 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
As far as futility goes,
your existence itself has no point at all!


00:08:40.039  --> 00:08:43.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now, tell us what's going on,
you weakling!


00:08:43.950  --> 00:08:45.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who the hell is this guy?


00:08:45.630  --> 00:08:48.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm supposed to have seniority!


00:08:48.170  --> 00:08:51.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Th-The crow gave us the order!


00:08:52.360  --> 00:08:55.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And then, ten of us Demon Slayers came here.


00:08:57.850  --> 00:09:00.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not long after we entered the mountain...


00:09:00.430  --> 00:09:02.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Some of the members...


00:09:19.590  --> 00:09:22.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They started killing each other!


00:09:33.950  --> 00:09:35.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I...


00:09:38.400  --> 00:09:40.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I...


00:09:45.810  --> 00:09:48.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You did well to return.


00:09:48.960  --> 00:09:54.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, most of my children
have been slaughtered?


00:09:54.010  --> 00:09:57.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We might find
the Twelve Kizuki there, then.


00:09:57.990  --> 00:10:01.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It seems that I'll have to send in the Hashira.


00:10:06.210  --> 00:10:07.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Giyu.


00:10:09.000  --> 00:10:10.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shinobu.


00:10:13.120  --> 00:10:14.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Understood!
- Understood!


00:10:16.080  --> 00:10:19.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If only humans and demons
could get along.


00:10:19.530  --> 00:10:21.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't you agree, Tomioka?


00:10:22.420  --> 00:10:24.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Impossible...


00:10:24.240  --> 00:10:26.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
as long as demons eat humans.


00:10:35.820  --> 00:10:39.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do they hate me?


00:10:40.290  --> 00:10:44.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Would someone normally leave
their friend behind by the roadside?


00:10:44.540  --> 00:10:47.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wouldn't you talk him through it
if you were friends?


00:10:47.200  --> 00:10:49.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- If they tried to convince me to go...
- Zenitsu.


00:10:49.380  --> 00:10:52.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- I guess I would've tagged along...
- Zenitsu.


00:10:52.670  --> 00:10:57.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But no, off they went on their merry way
up to that scary mountain.


00:10:58.670  --> 00:11:01.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Poor me, being left behind.


00:11:08.850  --> 00:11:12.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
(Sulking doesn't do any good.
You have to go help your friends now.)


00:11:14.100  --> 00:11:16.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Lucky you. Never need to have a care in the world.


00:11:16.530  --> 00:11:20.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You don't understand a thing
about humans, do you?


00:11:20.450  --> 00:11:23.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ouch, ouch, ouch!


00:11:23.200  --> 00:11:26.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're not cute at all!
Especially that side of you!


00:11:26.120  --> 00:11:28.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seriously, really not cute!


00:11:28.700  --> 00:11:31.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I mean, look how cute Nezuko is,
and she's a demon!


00:11:31.350  --> 00:11:33.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, you're a sparrow,
and you're so vicious!


00:11:35.760  --> 00:11:38.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He took Nezuko with him!


00:11:38.800  --> 00:11:42.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why did he have to take
my precious Nezuko with him?


00:11:42.260  --> 00:11:44.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Unbelievable, Tanjiro!


00:11:44.550  --> 00:11:46.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't bring a young girl to danger!


00:11:46.680  --> 00:11:48.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!


00:11:48.270  --> 00:11:51.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


00:12:00.390  --> 00:12:03.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is this sound?


00:12:03.300  --> 00:12:05.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not again.


00:12:05.620  --> 00:12:07.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's this sound again.


00:12:07.630  --> 00:12:13.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I heard this sound, and the next thing I knew,
everyone started killing each other.


00:12:13.330  --> 00:12:15.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where's it coming from?


00:12:57.500  --> 00:12:59.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
These guys are all morons.


00:12:59.680  --> 00:13:03.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They don't know that it's prohibited
for Demon Slayers to fight each other.


00:13:03.280  --> 00:13:04.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No, that's not it!


00:13:04.400  --> 00:13:05.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Their moves are strange.


00:13:05.840  --> 00:13:08.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're being controlled by something.


00:13:08.220  --> 00:13:10.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right.


00:13:10.200  --> 00:13:12.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going to slash them to ribbons!


00:13:12.450  --> 00:13:13.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You can't do that!


00:13:13.690  --> 00:13:14.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're alive.


00:13:14.810  --> 00:13:16.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Some of them are still alive.


00:13:16.850  --> 00:13:20.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Besides, we can't harm
the corpses of our comrades!


00:13:22.190  --> 00:13:26.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Stop denying me at every turn!


00:13:39.620  --> 00:13:43.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A strange sweet scent from his back!


00:13:49.760  --> 00:13:50.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's threads!


00:13:50.900  --> 00:13:52.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're being manipulated by threads!


00:13:52.430  --> 00:13:54.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cut the threads!


00:14:01.440  --> 00:14:04.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I already knew that
before you caught on.


00:14:04.690  --> 00:14:08.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where's the location
of the demon controlling them?


00:14:10.490  --> 00:14:11.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's this?


00:14:11.980  --> 00:14:15.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What an irritating odor!
Though it was just for a second!


00:14:18.500  --> 00:14:20.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
These areâ


00:14:29.320  --> 00:14:30.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Spiders!


00:14:30.690  --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, the spiders are weaving
the puppet strings?


00:14:33.540  --> 00:14:35.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That means...


00:14:43.450  --> 00:14:46.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now then, my sweet little dolls.


00:14:46.860  --> 00:14:50.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dance until your arms and legs fall off.


00:14:50.490  --> 00:14:52.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's not enough to just cut the threads!


00:14:52.620  --> 00:14:55.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The spiders will just spin more threads, so...


00:14:56.850  --> 00:14:58.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That acrid smell again.


00:14:58.770  --> 00:14:59.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is it anyway?


00:14:59.970  --> 00:15:02.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's being carried by the wind.


00:15:05.840  --> 00:15:09.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, all we gotta do
is kill those damn spiders, huh?


00:15:09.630  --> 00:15:10.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That would be impossible!


00:15:10.810  --> 00:15:13.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Those spiders are tiny,
and I'm sure there are tons of them.


00:15:13.640  --> 00:15:16.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We gotta find the demon
that's controlling them.


00:15:21.200  --> 00:15:22.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's no good, Inosuke!


00:15:22.880  --> 00:15:28.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke, if you have some way
to pinpoint the demon's location,


00:15:28.280  --> 00:15:29.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
then help me out!


00:15:29.820  --> 00:15:34.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This weird smell has been flowing in,
and my nose isn't working great.


00:15:34.660  --> 00:15:37.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And also, um...


00:15:37.250  --> 00:15:38.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's Murata!


00:15:38.330  --> 00:15:39.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Murata!


00:15:39.750  --> 00:15:43.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We will find a way to deal
with the people being controlled!


00:15:43.480  --> 00:15:44.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke, you...


00:15:59.160  --> 00:16:03.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't disturb my family's peaceful life.


00:16:06.340  --> 00:16:07.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is he floating?


00:16:07.650  --> 00:16:10.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No. He's standing on the threads.


00:16:10.640  --> 00:16:12.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What did he mean by "family"?


00:16:12.280  --> 00:16:16.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mother will kill you all right away.


00:16:17.410  --> 00:16:19.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mother?


00:16:29.610  --> 00:16:31.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Damn you!


00:16:31.340  --> 00:16:33.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where the hell do you think
you're going? Fight me!


00:16:33.930  --> 00:16:34.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Fightâ


00:16:34.820  --> 00:16:36.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke!


00:16:36.590  --> 00:16:39.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why did he show up anyway?


00:16:39.010  --> 00:16:42.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That kid probably isn't the demon pulling
the puppet strings!


00:16:42.340  --> 00:16:44.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, first, let's...


00:16:44.260  --> 00:16:45.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay, okay, okay!


00:16:45.930  --> 00:16:48.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I hear you, all right?


00:16:48.080  --> 00:16:50.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You want me to find
where that demon is, right?


00:16:50.840  --> 00:16:53.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shut up already, Forehead!


00:16:56.440  --> 00:16:59.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Beast Breathing, Seventh Form.


00:16:59.950  --> 00:17:02.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Spatial Awareness.


00:17:29.560  --> 00:17:31.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Found it!


00:17:31.400  --> 00:17:32.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There you are!


00:17:32.940  --> 00:17:34.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Found it?


00:17:34.430  --> 00:17:36.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yeah! That way!


00:17:36.320  --> 00:17:38.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm picking up
a strong presence over there.


00:17:38.880  --> 00:17:40.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You are?


00:17:40.160  --> 00:17:41.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Way to go, Inosuke!


00:17:45.240  --> 00:17:46.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit!


00:17:46.500  --> 00:17:49.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We gotta take care of these guys,
or we'll never get anywhere.


00:17:54.260  --> 00:17:59.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Damn... Isn't there...
Isn't there any way at all?


00:18:06.490  --> 00:18:09.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won't let anyone disturb us.


00:18:10.330  --> 00:18:15.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The five of us are going to live
in bliss as a family.


00:18:15.200  --> 00:18:19.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No one can break our bond.


00:18:30.470  --> 00:18:32.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit!


00:18:32.560  --> 00:18:33.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What a pain!


00:18:33.920  --> 00:18:35.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll just demolish them all at once.


00:18:35.710  --> 00:18:37.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No! You can't!


00:18:37.170  --> 00:18:39.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There has to be a way!


00:18:39.480  --> 00:18:42.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, let's try not to hurt theseâ


00:18:47.180  --> 00:18:48.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Murata?


00:18:48.690  --> 00:18:51.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Leave these guys to me
and go ahead!


00:18:51.520  --> 00:18:54.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What kind of talk is that, you bed-wetter?


00:18:54.570  --> 00:18:57.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I never pissed my pants,
you stupid boar!


00:18:57.530  --> 00:19:00.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wasn't talking to you,
so just shut up!


00:19:03.830  --> 00:19:06.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I know that wasn't
my finest moment back there,


00:19:06.170  --> 00:19:08.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
but I'm a Demon Slayer too.


00:19:08.500  --> 00:19:10.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll handle this.


00:19:10.630  --> 00:19:13.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now that I know I can cut the threads,


00:19:13.510  --> 00:19:17.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I also noticed that these guys can only make
simple movements.


00:19:17.140  --> 00:19:19.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll watch out for the spiders too.


00:19:19.290  --> 00:19:23.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Those controlled closer to the demon
must be stronger fighters.


00:19:23.770  --> 00:19:25.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, you two go ahead!


00:19:25.430  --> 00:19:27.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Understood! Thanks!


00:19:27.890  --> 00:19:29.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go, Inosuke!


00:19:30.920  --> 00:19:34.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm so going to punch you when I get back!


00:19:38.030  --> 00:19:41.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit! I'm gonna punch that guy!


00:19:41.360  --> 00:19:43.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Stop talking like that!


00:19:43.190  --> 00:19:45.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He called me "stupid boar," okay, Monjiro?


00:19:45.930  --> 00:19:47.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's Tanjiro!


00:19:47.720  --> 00:19:50.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Anyway, are we heading the right way?


00:19:50.460  --> 00:19:53.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My senses never lie.


00:19:53.170  --> 00:19:54.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But...


00:19:55.420  --> 00:19:58.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
what are all these annoying threads?


00:19:58.920  --> 00:20:02.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We must be closing in on the demon.


00:20:05.220  --> 00:20:07.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here's another bunch.


00:20:09.690  --> 00:20:11.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No.


00:20:12.890  --> 00:20:15.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't come any closer.


00:20:16.560  --> 00:20:20.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please summon someone of higher rank!


00:20:20.770  --> 00:20:24.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Otherwise, I'll end up killing everyone!


00:20:26.230  --> 00:20:27.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please...


00:20:28.950  --> 00:20:30.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please!


00:20:35.040  --> 00:20:38.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wonder if you can defeat them.


00:20:38.210  --> 00:20:41.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The closer you get to me,


00:20:41.130  --> 00:20:46.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
the thicker and stronger these threads are,
and the more powerful my dolls become.


00:20:47.700  --> 00:20:49.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mother.


00:20:52.390  --> 00:20:55.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You can win, right?


00:20:56.370  --> 00:20:57.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rui.


00:21:00.190  --> 00:21:04.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't you think
this is taking too much time?


00:21:09.810  --> 00:21:15.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You'd better hurry up,
or I'm gonna tell Father.


00:21:15.250  --> 00:21:18.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I-I can do it! I can do it, all right?


00:21:18.650  --> 00:21:20.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I promise to protect you!


00:21:20.380  --> 00:21:22.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, please! Not your father!


00:21:22.500  --> 00:21:25.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't tell your father! Just not him!


00:21:32.740  --> 00:21:35.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Then, hurry up.


00:21:51.410  --> 00:21:54.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Die! Die! Just die already!


00:21:54.620  --> 00:21:57.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Or else, there'll be hell for me to pay!


00:22:00.760  --> 00:22:02.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Run!


00:22:04.260  --> 00:22:05.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So fast!


00:22:05.770  --> 00:22:12.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm being controlled,
so my movements aren't my own at all!


00:22:12.200  --> 00:22:16.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We were never... this strong!


00:22:25.900  --> 00:22:29.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The demon's forcing her
to move her body with the threads,


00:22:29.160  --> 00:22:31.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and has no concern
if her bones get broken!


00:22:37.250  --> 00:22:38.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So cruel!


00:22:40.270  --> 00:22:42.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So stubborn.


00:22:42.250  --> 00:22:43.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How about this?


00:22:44.790  --> 00:22:46.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This sound!


00:22:49.920  --> 00:22:54.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
P-Please kill me...


00:22:54.070  --> 00:22:56.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My arms and... and legs...


00:22:56.980  --> 00:23:03.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The bones are piercing through my inner organs.


00:23:03.520  --> 00:23:08.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Every time I'm forced to move,
the pain's unbearable.


00:23:09.680  --> 00:23:13.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Either way, I'm dead.


00:23:14.680  --> 00:23:16.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, please help me!


00:23:16.630  --> 00:23:21.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please end our misery!


00:23:21.830  --> 00:23:23.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay, you got it!


00:23:23.750  --> 00:23:25.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Waitâ


00:23:26.020  --> 00:23:29.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hold up, will you?
We gotta find a way to help him!


00:23:29.410  --> 00:23:31.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh, shut up!


00:23:31.670  --> 00:23:34.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You really need to shut up!


00:23:34.390  --> 00:23:36.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But...


00:23:36.140  --> 00:23:39.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's asking us to kill him, all right?


00:23:42.830  --> 00:23:44.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
These guys are fast too.


00:23:44.690  --> 00:23:47.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you drag your feet,
we're going to go down!


00:23:47.280  --> 00:23:48.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I know that!


00:23:48.530  --> 00:23:50.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just give me a second to think.


00:23:50.650  --> 00:23:52.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't want to use any attacks.


00:23:52.770  --> 00:23:56.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, if we only slash the threads,
they'll just get reattached.


00:23:56.150  --> 00:23:58.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
To stop them from moving...


00:23:59.350  --> 00:24:00.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I know!


00:24:02.340  --> 00:24:03.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey!


00:24:08.180  --> 00:24:10.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Good. She's following me.


00:24:10.510  --> 00:24:14.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, why are you running around
in circles like that?


00:24:14.580  --> 00:24:16.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Quit fooling around!


00:24:23.130  --> 00:24:25.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Total Concentration!


00:24:27.970  --> 00:24:30.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's with his strength?!


00:24:35.940  --> 00:24:38.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right! You're all tangled up
like I planned!


00:24:41.940  --> 00:24:43.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wha...


00:24:44.370  --> 00:24:46.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's up with that?


00:24:46.520  --> 00:24:48.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wanna do that too!


00:24:53.880  --> 00:24:55.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take this!


00:25:04.520  --> 00:25:09.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You see that?
I can do whatever you can do!


00:25:09.190  --> 00:25:11.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My bad! I kind of missed it!


00:25:11.830  --> 00:25:13.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What?


00:25:13.240  --> 00:25:15.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I mean, you can't really blame me!


00:25:22.070  --> 00:25:23.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Damn!


00:25:23.650  --> 00:25:26.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're all such useless dolls.


00:25:27.310  --> 00:25:30.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I have no choice
but to unleash that doll, then.


00:25:44.120  --> 00:25:45.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just look at that!


00:25:45.510  --> 00:25:48.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
See? I've tossed up more than you!


00:25:48.340  --> 00:25:50.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right! One more to go.


00:25:50.200  --> 00:25:53.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay. I'm gonna do it one more time,
so make sure you watch.


00:25:53.840  --> 00:25:55.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right! You got it.


00:25:55.630  --> 00:25:57.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just don't be rough!


00:25:57.410  --> 00:26:01.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't need those fragile
human dolls anymore.


00:26:01.260  --> 00:26:02.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're useless!


00:26:02.490  --> 00:26:03.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Useless!


00:26:14.910  --> 00:26:18.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit! Now they're all dead.


00:26:41.230  --> 00:26:42.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go.


00:26:43.670  --> 00:26:45.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right.


00:26:49.580  --> 00:26:53.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This way! We're getting close!


00:26:53.550  --> 00:26:55.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now that the wind has changed direction,


00:26:55.250  --> 00:26:57.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
my sense of smell
is starting to come back.


00:26:57.570  --> 00:27:00.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, I'll be able to pinpoint
the demon's location.


00:27:00.940  --> 00:27:02.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There are two more scents.


00:27:02.960  --> 00:27:04.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There!


00:27:05.260  --> 00:27:06.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke!


00:27:06.810  --> 00:27:08.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I detected that thing before you did.


00:27:08.980  --> 00:27:11.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going to whack its head right off!


00:27:20.350  --> 00:27:21.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That thing...


00:27:22.580  --> 00:27:25.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
has no head!


00:27:26.550  --> 00:27:31.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko! Where are you?


00:27:38.210  --> 00:27:41.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where are you, Tanjiro, Inosuke?


00:27:41.940  --> 00:27:46.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't just leave me here all by myself
in this terrifying forest.


00:27:55.040  --> 00:27:56.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What was that?


00:27:57.860  --> 00:28:01.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You know what?
This is starting to make me really mad.


00:28:01.970  --> 00:28:07.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll find Nezuko as soon as possible,
then it's "bye bye" to this scary forest.


00:28:07.120  --> 00:28:10.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


00:28:22.840  --> 00:28:26.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That thing's got no weak spots.
I can't slash something that's not there.


00:28:27.780  --> 00:28:29.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke!


00:28:29.100  --> 00:28:30.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What do we do? What do we do?


00:28:30.930  --> 00:28:33.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Stay calm!
We can use diagonal cut.


00:28:33.600  --> 00:28:38.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's try slashing from the base of its neck
on the right side to his left waist!


00:28:38.090  --> 00:28:43.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's a lot to cover, and I'm sure
it's really tough, but I bet...


00:28:43.040  --> 00:28:45.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait! I mean together...


00:28:45.240  --> 00:28:46.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's fast!


00:28:46.160  --> 00:28:47.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But!


00:28:51.380  --> 00:28:53.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not so fast I can't dodge it!


00:28:54.540  --> 00:28:57.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Uh-oh! I forgot about the spiders!


00:28:59.520  --> 00:29:01.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't move.


00:29:01.640  --> 00:29:03.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm a dead man.


00:29:17.400  --> 00:29:21.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke, let's fight together!
Let's think together!


00:29:21.570  --> 00:29:25.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's work together
so we can bring down this demon!


00:29:25.700  --> 00:29:27.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Damn you!


00:29:27.400  --> 00:29:31.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't make me any giddier
than I already am!


00:29:33.580  --> 00:29:36.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're in my way!


00:29:36.960  --> 00:29:39.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke, launch yourself off me!


00:29:52.870  --> 00:29:56.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke, jump!


00:29:59.560  --> 00:30:03.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Total Concentration, Water Breathing.


00:30:03.040  --> 00:30:04.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Fourth Form,


00:30:06.780  --> 00:30:09.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Striking Tide!


00:30:14.040  --> 00:30:16.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Use diagonal cut!


00:30:16.120  --> 00:30:19.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit, what the hell?
This is so annoying.


00:30:19.910  --> 00:30:22.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's all going his way, huh?


00:30:22.850  --> 00:30:25.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's as if this whole thing
were predicted by him...


00:30:25.880  --> 00:30:30.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
as natural as water
flowing down a river's course.


00:30:32.260  --> 00:30:36.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's not the type about going first.


00:30:36.130  --> 00:30:40.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, he's watching the overall battle flow.


00:31:00.570  --> 00:31:02.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What a great cut!


00:31:02.960  --> 00:31:05.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nice! You defeated it, Inosuke!


00:31:10.840  --> 00:31:12.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke?


00:31:17.180  --> 00:31:21.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Anything you can do,
I can do, too, dumbass!


00:31:33.370  --> 00:31:35.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This scent...


00:31:35.260  --> 00:31:37.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, that's what this is about,
huh, Inosuke?


00:31:39.220  --> 00:31:41.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They got me! They got me!


00:31:41.680  --> 00:31:45.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even though that doll
was my fastest and strongest.


00:31:45.380  --> 00:31:48.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's Rui's fault for coming to me
with his threats.


00:31:48.700  --> 00:31:53.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's why I panicked!
I panicked! Panicked!


00:31:55.640  --> 00:31:57.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
From above?


00:31:58.900  --> 00:32:02.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, First Form!


00:32:02.230  --> 00:32:04.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He'll kill me! He'll cut off my head!


00:32:04.480  --> 00:32:07.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Think! I have to think!


00:32:10.940  --> 00:32:13.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But...


00:32:13.160  --> 00:32:16.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
if I die, I'll be freed.


00:32:21.140  --> 00:32:23.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And then, I'll find peace.


00:32:26.210  --> 00:32:27.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Fifth Form,


00:32:28.820  --> 00:32:30.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Blessed Rain After the Drought.


00:32:39.850  --> 00:32:41.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This is...


00:32:43.120  --> 00:32:46.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It feels like I'm being showered
by a gentle rain.


00:32:48.610  --> 00:32:51.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It doesn't hurt at all.


00:32:51.280  --> 00:32:53.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's not agonizing.


00:32:53.560  --> 00:32:56.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's simply warm.


00:32:59.430  --> 00:33:02.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I never dreamed that my end
would be this tranquil.


00:33:06.400  --> 00:33:10.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And now, I'm free.


00:33:21.220  --> 00:33:26.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm so sorry! I apologize,
so please forgive me!


00:33:26.060  --> 00:33:30.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What made you angry?
What caused you such displeasure?


00:33:34.420  --> 00:33:38.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your offense is not knowing
what made him mad.


00:33:39.410  --> 00:33:42.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, how could I?


00:33:43.830  --> 00:33:47.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Father's angry with Mother again.


00:33:54.920  --> 00:33:58.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Stop it! No! No!


00:34:13.500  --> 00:34:15.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Those eyes...


00:34:17.590  --> 00:34:19.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Such kind eyes...


00:34:22.400  --> 00:34:24.679 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Back when I was human,


00:34:24.679  --> 00:34:29.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I think someone used to look at me
with such kind eyes.


00:34:31.340  --> 00:34:34.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wonder who that was.


00:34:39.139  --> 00:34:42.179 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't remember.


00:34:42.179  --> 00:34:46.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It was someone who always treasured me.


00:34:49.980  --> 00:34:54.889 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wonder how that person is doing now.


00:35:06.020  --> 00:35:09.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's a Twelve Kizuki here.


00:35:11.370  --> 00:35:12.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait!


00:35:14.070  --> 00:35:16.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Be careful.


00:35:23.950  --> 00:35:27.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A Twelve Kizuki is here.


00:35:27.050  --> 00:35:31.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
An actual one...
here on this mountain.


00:35:45.800  --> 00:35:50.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The blood of the Twelve Kizuki
should have a high degree of Kibutsuji's blood.


00:35:50.600  --> 00:35:52.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I can extract it,


00:35:52.240  --> 00:35:56.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
the medicine that will turn Nezuko
back into a human can be completed sooner!


00:35:57.600  --> 00:35:59.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hold on! Inosuke!


00:36:03.180  --> 00:36:05.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, did you defeat it?


00:36:05.680  --> 00:36:08.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you all right, Inosuke?


00:36:08.410  --> 00:36:10.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I asked you whether you defeated
that thing or not!


00:36:10.860  --> 00:36:12.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Uh, yeah, I did.


00:36:12.190  --> 00:36:14.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But anyway, Inosuke,
how are you feeling?


00:36:14.570  --> 00:36:17.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't coddle me!


00:36:17.900  --> 00:36:20.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You hear me? Got this?


00:36:20.450  --> 00:36:23.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
After all, anything you can do,
I can do, too.


00:36:23.950  --> 00:36:28.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Before you know it,
my head will be harder than yours.


00:36:28.910  --> 00:36:31.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not to mention... Not to mention...


00:36:31.960  --> 00:36:33.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Um...


00:36:33.940  --> 00:36:36.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's wounded severely.


00:36:36.070  --> 00:36:39.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I couldn't save the others either.


00:36:39.930  --> 00:36:43.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That person gave off
the scent of terror and suffering.


00:36:45.840  --> 00:36:49.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Enough to make her yearn for death.


00:36:53.470  --> 00:36:56.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's happening on this mountain?


00:36:56.930  --> 00:36:59.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- With a Twelve Kizuki...
- Stay still, Inosuke!


00:36:59.070  --> 00:37:00.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- and a family of demons living here...
- Cut that out!


00:37:00.980  --> 00:37:02.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm totally fine!


00:37:02.530  --> 00:37:06.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I thought demons didn't group up.


00:37:09.410  --> 00:37:10.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ouch!


00:37:13.670  --> 00:37:15.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That hurts.


00:37:15.920  --> 00:37:18.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Something just pricked me!


00:37:18.260  --> 00:37:21.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What the hell? This is so annoying!


00:37:21.510  --> 00:37:24.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't even find Tanjiro and Inosuke
anywhere! This sucks!


00:37:24.360  --> 00:37:26.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where did they go?


00:37:26.600  --> 00:37:28.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Which way?


00:37:28.260  --> 00:37:31.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And it stinks around here, too! Stinks!


00:37:31.770  --> 00:37:34.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I think I'm going to cry.


00:37:34.270  --> 00:37:37.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And, this sound of spiders
skittering around is so creepy!


00:37:37.630  --> 00:37:41.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sure these spiders are just trying
to survive, too, but still!


00:37:43.190  --> 00:37:45.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit! Shut up! Stop moving!


00:37:48.780  --> 00:37:52.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is this even possible?


00:37:55.940  --> 00:37:58.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's a spider with a human face!


00:37:58.980  --> 00:38:01.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's up with that? What's up with that?


00:38:01.600  --> 00:38:05.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please be a dream! Please be a dream!
Please be a dream!


00:38:05.090  --> 00:38:08.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If this can just be a dream,
I promise to work harder!


00:38:08.350  --> 00:38:11.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I wake up to find myself
resting my head on Nezuko's lap,


00:38:11.040  --> 00:38:12.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
then I promise to give it all I have!


00:38:12.780  --> 00:38:14.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll even plow fields!


00:38:14.710  --> 00:38:17.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll be glad to plow a whole acre--
no, even two acres!


00:38:17.480  --> 00:38:19.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, please!


00:38:19.600  --> 00:38:24.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let me wake up from this nightmare!


00:38:37.580  --> 00:38:40.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What the heck is that?


00:38:40.300  --> 00:38:44.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are those humans being turned into spiders?


00:38:44.790  --> 00:38:46.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is that house floating?


00:38:46.820  --> 00:38:49.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can see a glimpse of something.
Are those threads?


00:38:49.590  --> 00:38:51.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Also, it really stinks!


00:38:51.620  --> 00:38:53.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Talk about pungent.


00:38:53.510  --> 00:38:56.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This would kill Tanjiro
with his keen sense of smell.


00:38:56.520  --> 00:38:58.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This smell is making my throat ache.


00:38:58.960  --> 00:39:00.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm tearing up.


00:39:00.690  --> 00:39:02.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My eyes hurt too.


00:39:16.790  --> 00:39:19.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Big! It's huge!


00:39:19.330  --> 00:39:20.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's massive!


00:39:20.900  --> 00:39:22.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That thing is too huge!


00:39:28.550  --> 00:39:32.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You know what?
I don't want to talk with you!


00:39:37.680  --> 00:39:40.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's no use running away.


00:39:40.070  --> 00:39:42.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You've already lost.


00:39:42.020  --> 00:39:44.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you muttering about?


00:39:44.000  --> 00:39:45.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't talk to me!


00:39:45.860  --> 00:39:48.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I hate guys like you!


00:39:48.720  --> 00:39:52.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You already know
how dire your situation is, don't you?


00:39:52.550  --> 00:39:53.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you talking about?


00:39:53.920  --> 00:39:55.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take a look at your hand.


00:39:55.360  --> 00:39:56.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Huh? My hand?


00:39:58.600  --> 00:40:00.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's wrong with my handâ


00:40:02.640  --> 00:40:04.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's this?


00:40:04.420  --> 00:40:06.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's poison.


00:40:06.040  --> 00:40:08.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You got bitten by a spider, right?


00:40:08.420  --> 00:40:11.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That poison will turn you into a spider too.


00:40:14.180  --> 00:40:19.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
In another 30 minutes, you'll be my slave,
crawling across the earth.


00:40:21.430  --> 00:40:23.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Look at this. It's a clock.


00:40:23.680  --> 00:40:25.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you understand?


00:40:25.380  --> 00:40:28.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
By the time this long hand
goes around once,


00:40:28.190  --> 00:40:31.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
you'll have joined the spiders.


00:40:31.190  --> 00:40:33.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
When the needle arrives here,


00:40:33.060  --> 00:40:36.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
you'll start to feel tingling
and pain in your limbs.


00:40:36.280  --> 00:40:40.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
When it's here,
you'll also feel dizzy and nauseous.


00:40:40.320  --> 00:40:42.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here, you'll experience intense pain,


00:40:42.930  --> 00:40:45.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
your body will start to shrink,
and you'll black out.


00:40:45.800  --> 00:40:48.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And by the time you wake up...


00:41:25.160  --> 00:41:26.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Running away--


00:41:26.320  --> 00:41:28.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is futile! Yeah, I know!


00:41:28.000  --> 00:41:31.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I know that, all right? I know that!


00:41:34.710  --> 00:41:36.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What do you think you're doing?


00:41:36.510  --> 00:41:38.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shut up! Just shut up!


00:41:38.760  --> 00:41:41.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's no need to be afraid.


00:41:41.350  --> 00:41:45.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Once the poison makes its rounds and you turn
into a spider, your mind will be gone too.


00:41:45.100  --> 00:41:48.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No! That's exactly what I don't want!


00:41:48.480  --> 00:41:50.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why can't you understand that, huh?


00:41:50.610  --> 00:41:53.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I bet you have no friends or girlfriend!
No one would like you!


00:41:53.320  --> 00:41:58.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Huh! I can see that you want an extra dose
of poison to turn into a spider faster.


00:42:03.060  --> 00:42:07.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No! No! I don't want to turn into that!


00:42:08.720  --> 00:42:10.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pull yourself together!


00:42:10.460  --> 00:42:12.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Stop crying! Stop running away!


00:42:12.630  --> 00:42:15.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Such behavior won't get you anywhere!


00:42:15.130  --> 00:42:17.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Zenitsu!


00:42:17.130  --> 00:42:20.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come down from there!
We're going to continue training!


00:42:20.640  --> 00:42:24.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No! I'm sure I'll die
if I train any more!


00:42:24.140  --> 00:42:26.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sure that I'll die!


00:42:26.680  --> 00:42:29.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This level of training won't kill you.


00:42:29.710  --> 00:42:31.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come down from there, you fool!


00:42:31.820  --> 00:42:33.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Gramps!


00:42:33.030  --> 00:42:35.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Call me "Master"!


00:42:35.030  --> 00:42:37.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I love to call you Gramps!


00:42:40.560  --> 00:42:44.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
When the girl I loved made me raise money
so she could run off with another guy,


00:42:44.850  --> 00:42:47.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
you did rescue me
from my mountain of debt.


00:42:47.790  --> 00:42:51.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, maybe all you wanted
was to train a swordsman.


00:42:51.460  --> 00:42:54.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want to live up to your expectations!


00:42:54.610  --> 00:42:56.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, it's totally beyond me!


00:42:56.210  --> 00:43:00.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I do feel terrible
about the fact that I'm like this!


00:43:00.220  --> 00:43:02.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've been training
on my own in secret too!


00:43:02.660  --> 00:43:04.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've been barely sleeping!


00:43:04.720  --> 00:43:07.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I have no result!


00:43:07.250  --> 00:43:10.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What does this mean?
I mean, really, what does this mean?


00:43:10.810  --> 00:43:14.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Calm down, Zenitsu!
You do have the talent.


00:43:14.730  --> 00:43:16.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No, I don't!


00:43:19.740  --> 00:43:22.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Zenitsu!


00:43:23.970  --> 00:43:26.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What a miserable life.


00:43:26.290  --> 00:43:28.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I got struck by lightning.


00:43:29.820  --> 00:43:32.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It changed my hair color.


00:43:34.300  --> 00:43:37.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was thankful just to be alive, but...


00:43:39.710  --> 00:43:41.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I...


00:43:41.300  --> 00:43:44.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I hate myself more than anyone else.


00:43:45.880  --> 00:43:48.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I always try to get my act together,


00:43:48.960  --> 00:43:53.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
but I end up cowering,
running away and sniveling.


00:43:54.730  --> 00:43:58.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want to change.
I want to be a capable individual.


00:43:59.740  --> 00:44:01.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even still!


00:44:01.070  --> 00:44:03.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm doing everything I can!


00:44:03.720  --> 00:44:07.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why do I have to end up going bald
and turning into a monster?


00:44:07.160  --> 00:44:09.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It can't be true, right? It can't be!


00:44:12.360  --> 00:44:14.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's up with this guy?


00:44:18.000  --> 00:44:20.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh, crap! Don't climb up here!


00:44:20.450  --> 00:44:22.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just leave me alone for a minute!


00:44:22.760  --> 00:44:26.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just for a minute, all right?


00:44:32.260  --> 00:44:35.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My hair's falling out already?


00:44:35.650  --> 00:44:37.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Losing hair...


00:44:37.650  --> 00:44:40.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, he never mentioned that part to me!


00:44:50.650  --> 00:44:52.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is with this guy?


00:44:52.860  --> 00:44:57.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Isn't he a Demon Slayer
who came here to kill our family?


00:44:57.240  --> 00:44:58.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did he just faint?


00:44:58.920  --> 00:45:01.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't believe how spineless he is.


00:45:03.040  --> 00:45:05.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's going to fall on his head and die.


00:45:05.750  --> 00:45:07.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What the hell?


00:45:14.640  --> 00:45:18.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thunder Breathing, First Form.


00:45:26.390  --> 00:45:28.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Poison Sputum!


00:45:35.170  --> 00:45:38.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did he just twist his body
in midair to dodge that?


00:45:38.400  --> 00:45:41.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Such quick reflexes.
It's like he's a totally different person.


00:45:43.920  --> 00:45:46.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thunder Breathing, First Form.


00:45:46.970  --> 00:45:49.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, you guys! Pounce on him!


00:45:52.940  --> 00:45:56.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thunder Breathing, First Form.


00:46:00.480  --> 00:46:04.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's been assuming
the same stance over and over.


00:46:06.070  --> 00:46:09.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Obviously, this guy...


00:46:10.060  --> 00:46:13.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
must only know one technique.


00:46:14.890  --> 00:46:17.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's all right, Zenitsu.


00:46:17.090  --> 00:46:19.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's good enough for you.


00:46:19.470  --> 00:46:22.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mastering even one is cause for celebration.


00:46:23.850  --> 00:46:28.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you can only do a single thing,
hone it to perfection.


00:46:31.050  --> 00:46:35.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Polish it to the utmost limit!


00:46:36.380  --> 00:46:38.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, Gramps...


00:46:38.660  --> 00:46:41.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just a little while ago, you were furious.


00:46:41.440  --> 00:46:46.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because Thunder Breathing has six forms,
and all I can manage to do is one.


00:46:48.060  --> 00:46:51.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you know how to forge a sword?


00:46:53.900  --> 00:46:55.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I have no idea.


00:46:55.280  --> 00:46:58.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Will you keep hitting me? I think I'll cry.


00:46:59.600  --> 00:47:01.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The thing about swords...


00:47:01.280  --> 00:47:03.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You strike and strike and strike


00:47:03.760  --> 00:47:06.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
to get rid of impurities
and anything you don't need.


00:47:06.140  --> 00:47:11.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
By refining the purity of the steel,
a strong sword is forged.


00:47:11.340  --> 00:47:15.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, that's why you keep
clobbering me day in, day out?


00:47:16.790  --> 00:47:19.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I'm not made of steel, am I?


00:47:19.770  --> 00:47:22.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm living flesh, you know.


00:47:23.520  --> 00:47:26.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're not much of a threat, are you?


00:47:26.050  --> 00:47:28.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You call yourself a Demon Slayer?


00:47:28.110  --> 00:47:32.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Any minute now, you'll be rendered
immobile by that poison.


00:47:33.420  --> 00:47:36.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Zenitsu, perfect it!


00:47:36.120  --> 00:47:37.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's all right to cry.


00:47:37.700  --> 00:47:39.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's all right to run away.


00:47:40.130  --> 00:47:43.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just don't ever give up!


00:47:43.080  --> 00:47:45.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just believe.


00:47:45.590  --> 00:47:49.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You endured all that hellish training.


00:47:49.080  --> 00:47:51.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You'll be rewarded for that without fail.


00:47:51.920  --> 00:47:53.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hone it to the utmost limit.


00:47:53.850  --> 00:47:57.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Become the most durable blade of all!


00:47:58.220  --> 00:48:00.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You must master a single thing!


00:48:08.080  --> 00:48:09.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Get lost.


00:48:14.710  --> 00:48:18.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't make me repeat myself.
Get lost.


00:48:19.350  --> 00:48:21.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You know what I'm talking about.


00:48:21.410  --> 00:48:26.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Aren't you ashamed
of crying like a baby all day long?


00:48:29.100  --> 00:48:30.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You laggard.


00:48:30.410  --> 00:48:34.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Any time spent on you is wasted.


00:48:34.660  --> 00:48:37.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sensei is an extraordinary man.


00:48:37.580  --> 00:48:39.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, Gramps saidâ


00:48:40.100  --> 00:48:43.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Gramps"? Don't speak of him
in that familiar way!


00:48:44.390  --> 00:48:46.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sensei is a former Hashira!


00:48:46.460  --> 00:48:49.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Someone who earned the highest rank
in the Demon Slayer Corps!


00:48:50.690  --> 00:48:54.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's a rare chance to receive instruction
from a former Hashira!


00:48:54.910  --> 00:48:59.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The time Sensei spends training you
is all for nothing!


00:48:59.660  --> 00:49:02.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're an eyesore! Get lost!


00:49:02.160  --> 00:49:04.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why are you here?


00:49:04.540  --> 00:49:07.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why do you insist on clinging here?


00:49:17.400  --> 00:49:21.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I have no parents,
so no one expects anything of me.


00:49:21.980  --> 00:49:28.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's no one who dreams that I'll grasp
or accomplish something one day.


00:49:30.280  --> 00:49:32.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That I'll prove myself useful to somebody.


00:49:32.240  --> 00:49:34.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That I'll manage to protect somebody


00:49:34.310  --> 00:49:37.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and make that person happy,
just once in my life.


00:49:37.110  --> 00:49:39.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not even a simple future like that.


00:49:39.990  --> 00:49:42.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's no one who hopes that I'll have one.


00:49:42.850  --> 00:49:46.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you fail, cry and run away even once,


00:49:46.150  --> 00:49:50.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
they say, "Oh, this guy's no good,"
and they move on.


00:49:51.750  --> 00:49:53.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But not Gramps!


00:49:57.340  --> 00:50:01.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Time and time again,
he steadfastly reprimanded me.


00:50:03.320  --> 00:50:06.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All those times I ran away...


00:50:07.350  --> 00:50:09.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Time and time again...


00:50:09.860  --> 00:50:11.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
he'd drag me right back.


00:50:14.740  --> 00:50:18.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Clearly, he went a little too far
that time, though.


00:50:19.240  --> 00:50:22.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, he never abandoned me!


00:50:22.990  --> 00:50:26.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pierce him! Inject him with more poison!


00:50:39.210  --> 00:50:41.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That should do it for him!


00:50:46.430  --> 00:50:48.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's this?


00:50:48.290  --> 00:50:49.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The air is vibrating.


00:50:52.770  --> 00:50:56.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thunder Breathing, First Form.


00:50:56.280  --> 00:50:57.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thunderclap and Flash.


00:51:00.700  --> 00:51:02.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sixfold!


00:51:07.830  --> 00:51:09.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He vanished?


00:51:29.670  --> 00:51:31.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Was I cut?


00:51:31.360  --> 00:51:36.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Me? Cut by him?


00:51:36.650  --> 00:51:38.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
By a guy like him?


00:51:45.450  --> 00:51:47.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't be defeated...


00:51:47.380  --> 00:51:51.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
by a guy who can barely move
his arms and legs?


00:52:00.440  --> 00:52:02.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I saw a dream.


00:52:03.690  --> 00:52:06.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A happy dream.


00:52:06.180  --> 00:52:07.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm powerful.


00:52:07.920  --> 00:52:10.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
More powerful than anyone.


00:52:10.000  --> 00:52:14.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can help the weak and anyone in trouble.


00:52:14.450  --> 00:52:16.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Anytime.


00:52:16.870  --> 00:52:19.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Everything that Gramps taught me,


00:52:19.620  --> 00:52:21.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
all the time he spent on me...


00:52:21.530  --> 00:52:24.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It wasn't for nothing.


00:52:24.030  --> 00:52:27.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A dream that, thanks to Gramps,


00:52:27.360  --> 00:52:32.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I became powerful
and helped out a lot of people.


00:52:33.650  --> 00:52:37.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But now, it's all over.


00:52:42.280  --> 00:52:45.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Chuntaro...


00:52:46.420  --> 00:52:49.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm so sorry.


00:52:59.730  --> 00:53:01.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't ever give up!


00:53:11.400  --> 00:53:13.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't ever give up.


00:53:13.540  --> 00:53:18.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Use the breathing technique to slow down
the poison as much as I can.


00:53:18.850  --> 00:53:22.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if it's painful, even if it's agonizing,


00:53:22.180  --> 00:53:24.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
don't try to take the easy way out...


00:53:24.560  --> 00:53:27.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
or Gramps will whoop me.


00:53:27.940  --> 00:53:29.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right.


00:53:29.700  --> 00:53:33.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And Tanjiro's going to yell at me too.


00:53:36.230  --> 00:53:38.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What was that sound?


00:53:38.130  --> 00:53:40.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did lightning just strike?


00:53:40.050  --> 00:53:41.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How should I know?


00:53:42.050  --> 00:53:45.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I'm not smelling any thunderclouds.


00:53:45.390  --> 00:53:48.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The acrid odor in the air
is so much stronger that I can't tell.


00:53:48.700  --> 00:53:50.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke.


00:53:51.790  --> 00:53:54.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I think I'll go that way.


00:53:54.850  --> 00:53:58.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Go ahead and do whatever you want.


00:53:58.130  --> 00:54:00.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You should descend the mountain.


00:54:01.870  --> 00:54:03.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Huh?


00:54:03.090  --> 00:54:04.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Go down the mountain.


00:54:04.970  --> 00:54:07.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why would I? Just beat it!


00:54:07.240  --> 00:54:09.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, because you're severely wounded.


00:54:09.970  --> 00:54:12.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not wounded at all!


00:54:16.480  --> 00:54:22.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
N-N-No, Inosuke!
Anyone can see your injuries.


00:54:26.450  --> 00:54:27.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A demon!


00:54:27.820  --> 00:54:30.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because of the odor wafting
all over this mountain,


00:54:30.610  --> 00:54:32.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I didn't notice at all.


00:54:34.450  --> 00:54:38.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll tear you to shreds, you demon!


00:54:38.680  --> 00:54:40.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come back here!


00:54:40.250  --> 00:54:41.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke!


00:54:43.300  --> 00:54:44.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Father!


00:54:44.460  --> 00:54:46.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who are you calling "Father"?


00:54:48.260  --> 00:54:49.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke!


00:55:01.360  --> 00:55:07.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't come near my family!


00:55:09.840  --> 00:55:13.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm leaving the rest to you, Father.


00:55:17.040  --> 00:55:19.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, Second Form!


00:55:19.710  --> 00:55:21.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Wheel!


00:55:45.900  --> 00:55:49.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Were you acquainted with any of them?


00:55:50.290  --> 00:55:54.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There doesn't seem to be
any survivors around here.


00:55:55.030  --> 00:56:01.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We were informed that several
rookie Mizunoto had joined the battle,


00:56:02.790  --> 00:56:05.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
but they might be dead by now,
don't you think?


00:56:06.520  --> 00:56:08.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go.


00:56:09.490  --> 00:56:12.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Isn't the moon lovely?


00:56:13.700  --> 00:56:18.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Since we've been given this
joint mission, let's try to get along.


00:56:19.300  --> 00:56:21.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My only concern is slaying demons.


00:56:21.800  --> 00:56:24.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How cold-hearted of you.


00:56:24.980  --> 00:56:28.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right, then, let's split up here.


00:56:28.300  --> 00:56:30.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I shall proceed from the west.


00:56:30.690  --> 00:56:32.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Very well.


00:56:41.610  --> 00:56:44.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's no good.
The blade won't cut through.


00:56:52.590  --> 00:56:57.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So... so tough!


00:57:02.600  --> 00:57:04.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't cut him even if I use my forms.


00:57:04.850  --> 00:57:07.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What should I do?


00:57:09.020  --> 00:57:15.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't come near my family!


00:57:19.760  --> 00:57:22.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you looking at?
I'm over here!


00:57:22.790  --> 00:57:24.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Die!


00:57:31.420  --> 00:57:33.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ouch!


00:57:33.440  --> 00:57:36.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All that force
with just one swipe of its arm!


00:57:36.500  --> 00:57:39.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's no good.
I'm not at full power.


00:57:39.930  --> 00:57:43.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not to mention,
the bleeding's making me stumble.


00:57:50.370  --> 00:57:54.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, Second Form Improved...


00:57:54.660  --> 00:57:56.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Lateral Water Wheel!


00:58:17.520  --> 00:58:19.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What was that?


00:58:19.390  --> 00:58:20.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's going on?


00:58:20.870  --> 00:58:23.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke! You okay?


00:58:25.620  --> 00:58:27.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He did that?


00:58:27.730  --> 00:58:30.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That was some move, dammit!


00:58:37.300  --> 00:58:38.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right!


00:58:38.440  --> 00:58:41.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I should be able to chop off
that tough neck now.


00:58:41.620  --> 00:58:46.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
With the final and most powerful form
of Water Breathing!


00:58:50.630  --> 00:58:52.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's got a different air about him now.


00:58:52.960  --> 00:58:57.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's about to do
something totally mind-blowing.


00:58:59.030  --> 00:59:01.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll finish him with this!


00:59:03.640  --> 00:59:05.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Total Concentration...


00:59:05.270  --> 00:59:08.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, Tenth Form!


00:59:17.020  --> 00:59:17.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
L-Look out!


00:59:20.840  --> 00:59:22.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kentaro!


00:59:23.420  --> 00:59:25.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke!


00:59:25.010  --> 00:59:27.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't die until I get back!


00:59:27.910  --> 00:59:30.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's one of the Twelve Kizuki!


00:59:30.380  --> 00:59:33.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't die! Don't die!


00:59:33.020  --> 00:59:35.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Whatever you do, don't die!


00:59:47.850  --> 00:59:49.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh, crap!


01:00:03.360  --> 01:00:08.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's getting really hard to breathe now.


01:00:08.840  --> 01:00:18.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I have no feeling
in my arms and legs anymore.


01:00:29.950  --> 01:00:32.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko.


01:00:32.190  --> 01:00:34.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry.


01:00:40.900  --> 01:00:43.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't give up!


01:00:43.940  --> 01:00:46.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't give up!


01:00:47.040  --> 01:00:49.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't give up!


01:00:50.000  --> 01:00:54.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't... give... up...


01:01:17.590  --> 01:01:20.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who are you?


01:01:24.070  --> 01:01:26.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hello there.


01:01:26.010  --> 01:01:28.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you all right?


01:01:33.960  --> 01:01:36.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, Second Form!


01:01:38.410  --> 01:01:39.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Wheel!


01:01:47.400  --> 01:01:49.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I stuck that landing somehow.


01:01:52.730  --> 01:01:55.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I beg of you! Please stop!


01:02:24.760  --> 01:02:26.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you looking at?


01:02:26.980  --> 01:02:29.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This isn't some show, you know.


01:02:31.240  --> 01:02:33.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wh-What are you doing?


01:02:33.770  --> 01:02:36.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Aren't you two friends?


01:02:36.980  --> 01:02:39.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Friends?


01:02:39.140  --> 01:02:42.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't put us in the same category
as something that flimsy.


01:02:42.860  --> 01:02:45.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We're family.


01:02:45.180  --> 01:02:48.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We're connected by a strong bond.


01:02:48.520  --> 01:02:54.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And besides,
this is between me and my sister.


01:02:54.090  --> 01:02:56.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, don't interfere...


01:02:56.660  --> 01:02:59.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
or I'll carve you up.


01:03:00.780  --> 01:03:02.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're wrong.


01:03:02.320  --> 01:03:06.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Whether you're family or friends,
if you have a strong bond,


01:03:06.500  --> 01:03:08.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
then both are just as precious.


01:03:08.900  --> 01:03:12.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Calling it flimsy
if you're not related by blood...


01:03:12.130  --> 01:03:14.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
is not true at all!


01:03:14.160  --> 01:03:19.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not only that, but those who have
a strong bond give off the scent of trust.


01:03:19.680  --> 01:03:24.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, all I'm picking up from you two
is the scent of terror, hatred and loathing.


01:03:25.480  --> 01:03:27.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's not what you call a bond!


01:03:27.930  --> 01:03:29.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's forged!


01:03:29.490  --> 01:03:31.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's fake!


01:03:36.640  --> 01:03:38.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You...


01:03:43.310  --> 01:03:47.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey! Look at that,
a demon that's just the right size.


01:03:47.550  --> 01:03:51.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even I can take down
a kid demon like this one.


01:03:52.300  --> 01:03:53.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hold onâ


01:03:53.280  --> 01:03:55.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You can just stay back.


01:03:55.180  --> 01:03:58.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want to take the safe route
up the ladder.


01:03:58.520  --> 01:04:03.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And, a higher rank means
more money in my pockets.


01:04:03.060  --> 01:04:06.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My unit's practically been wiped out,


01:04:06.580  --> 01:04:12.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
but I'll slay myself a decent-sized demon
and head down the mountain.


01:04:12.140  --> 01:04:13.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take this!


01:04:13.120  --> 01:04:15.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't do it! Stop!


01:04:21.370  --> 01:04:23.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sliced to pieces in an instant!


01:04:23.760  --> 01:04:25.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, how did he...


01:04:26.430  --> 01:04:29.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, what did you say?


01:04:33.690  --> 01:04:39.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What was it that you said just now?


01:04:41.520  --> 01:04:44.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What an intimidating aura!


01:04:44.190  --> 01:04:48.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The air just got heavy and thick.


01:04:50.210  --> 01:04:53.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Inosuke, I'm sorry.


01:04:53.080  --> 01:04:56.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hang in there a little longer.


01:04:56.470  --> 01:04:59.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll be there as soon as I defeat this demon


01:05:00.660  --> 01:05:04.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll come save you no matter what!


01:05:04.400  --> 01:05:10.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's hear what you said just now.


01:05:11.670  --> 01:05:15.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Repeat it, will you?


01:05:15.220  --> 01:05:18.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll repeat it as many times as you want!


01:05:18.440  --> 01:05:21.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your bond is fake!


01:05:47.340  --> 01:05:49.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Crap!


01:06:03.830  --> 01:06:05.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit!


01:06:05.140  --> 01:06:07.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hiding myself in a place like this...


01:06:07.650  --> 01:06:09.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How pathetic I am.


01:06:09.650  --> 01:06:16.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Still, I gotta come up with a way
to cut something that sword can't.


01:06:16.670  --> 01:06:19.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What do I do?


01:06:19.810  --> 01:06:22.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just how do I slash it?


01:06:22.830  --> 01:06:26.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Think! Think! Think! Thiâ


01:06:26.950  --> 01:06:29.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dammit!


01:06:30.820  --> 01:06:34.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This is bad! This is really bad!


01:06:34.050  --> 01:06:35.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Until...


01:06:35.450  --> 01:06:37.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Until he gets back,


01:06:37.600  --> 01:06:39.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I gotta somehow...


01:06:41.850  --> 01:06:44.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why the hell am I thinking like that?


01:06:46.440  --> 01:06:48.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't be ridiculous, dammit!


01:06:55.490  --> 01:06:57.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bloody hell!


01:06:58.410  --> 01:07:02.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Looks like I got infected
by Tontaro's germs!


01:07:02.830  --> 01:07:06.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Messing around like that...
That was a close call!


01:07:06.830  --> 01:07:11.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Using my head is not my style!


01:07:16.050  --> 01:07:19.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right! Slashed ya!


01:07:20.590  --> 01:07:22.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's that simple.


01:07:22.820  --> 01:07:24.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you can't slash something
with one sword,


01:07:24.970  --> 01:07:28.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
all you gotta do is pound it
with another sword.


01:07:28.370  --> 01:07:32.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because, look, I have two swords!


01:07:35.190  --> 01:07:37.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm the almighty!


01:07:42.450  --> 01:07:44.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you running away from me?


01:07:44.620  --> 01:07:45.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey you!


01:07:45.960  --> 01:07:47.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come back here, dammit!


01:08:00.840  --> 01:08:06.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just so you know...
I won't kill you in one blow.


01:08:06.090  --> 01:08:10.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
After ripping you to shreds,
I'll carve you up.


01:08:13.610  --> 01:08:17.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
However, if you take back
what you said just now,


01:08:17.970  --> 01:08:20.569 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll do you a favor
and kill you at once.


01:08:20.569  --> 01:08:25.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won't! I'm not wrong!


01:08:25.060  --> 01:08:28.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The one who's wrong is you!


01:08:35.090  --> 01:08:38.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're the one who's mistaken!


01:08:54.390  --> 01:08:58.859 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Damn! Where the hell did
that bastard go, dammit?


01:09:02.640  --> 01:09:06.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This doesn't hurt.


01:09:06.180  --> 01:09:09.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What doesn't hurt doesn't hurt!


01:09:09.450  --> 01:09:13.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now that it's come to this,
I'll sniff it out for sure.


01:09:25.640  --> 01:09:27.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There you are!


01:09:27.470  --> 01:09:31.979 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You idiot piece of crap!
How high did you climb up?


01:09:31.979  --> 01:09:33.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bastard...


01:09:33.600  --> 01:09:37.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, you're plotting to make me
use my head again, huh?


01:09:37.290  --> 01:09:38.979 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
In your dreams!


01:09:42.990  --> 01:09:44.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What the...


01:09:44.660  --> 01:09:46.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh, I get it.


01:09:46.580  --> 01:09:50.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's trembling with fear and dread
at the sight of me, huh?


01:09:51.990  --> 01:09:54.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, it's a little too late for that!


01:09:59.590  --> 01:10:01.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What the... Now what?


01:10:06.930  --> 01:10:09.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I-Is he molting?


01:10:20.230  --> 01:10:21.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yikes...


01:10:21.820  --> 01:10:25.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on, that's too big even for me.


01:10:25.490  --> 01:10:27.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This is looking really bad.


01:10:27.780  --> 01:10:32.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've never sensed this much pressure
from an opponent before.


01:10:32.480  --> 01:10:35.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll get crushed just by the pressure.


01:10:39.820  --> 01:10:41.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's no good.


01:10:41.750  --> 01:10:43.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't win.


01:10:50.760  --> 01:10:52.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm gonna die.


01:10:54.010  --> 01:10:55.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm gonna be killed.


01:10:56.520  --> 01:10:57.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't die!


01:10:59.060  --> 01:11:01.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't die until I get back!


01:11:02.910  --> 01:11:08.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Always live your lives with great pride.


01:11:08.860  --> 01:11:11.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wish you luck in battle.


01:11:13.120  --> 01:11:16.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won't lose!


01:11:16.120  --> 01:11:18.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No way am I going to lose!


01:11:18.830  --> 01:11:22.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm Inosuke Hashibira
of the Demon Slayer Corps!


01:11:22.980  --> 01:11:25.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bring it on, you scum!


01:11:27.380  --> 01:11:28.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So fast!


01:11:28.840  --> 01:11:30.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't see it!


01:11:36.600  --> 01:11:39.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Beast Breathing...


01:11:39.120  --> 01:11:42.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Third Fang, Devour!


01:11:44.610  --> 01:11:46.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They snapped!


01:11:50.860  --> 01:11:52.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Crap!


01:11:52.500  --> 01:11:55.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I failed to catch my fall
with a breathing technique.


01:11:56.780  --> 01:12:00.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't come near my family!


01:12:02.020  --> 01:12:04.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I refuse to die.


01:12:04.400  --> 01:12:08.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Beast Breathing, First Fang.


01:12:08.190  --> 01:12:09.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take this!


01:12:09.630  --> 01:12:11.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pierce!


01:12:13.410  --> 01:12:15.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I stabbed it!


01:12:15.170  --> 01:12:17.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I stabbed it, but...


01:12:17.120  --> 01:12:18.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
what the hell?


01:12:18.930  --> 01:12:21.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This thing isn't even flinching.


01:12:41.220  --> 01:12:42.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Forgive me.


01:12:45.250  --> 01:12:48.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry, Inosuke.


01:13:00.240  --> 01:13:04.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want you, at least, to survive, Inosuke.


01:13:11.320  --> 01:13:15.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wh-Who are you?


01:13:25.460  --> 01:13:27.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wh-What was that?


01:13:28.930  --> 01:13:32.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did he actually cut through him?


01:13:32.590  --> 01:13:37.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wh-Who is he?


01:13:47.940  --> 01:13:49.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's fast!


01:13:50.710  --> 01:13:53.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, Fourth Form.


01:13:53.780  --> 01:13:55.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Striking Tide.


01:14:03.330  --> 01:14:06.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
H-Holy crap!


01:14:10.890  --> 01:14:17.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I-I've never seen anyone...
as incredible as this guy!


01:14:25.350  --> 01:14:26.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Got it.


01:14:26.690  --> 01:14:29.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The stench is starting to fade...


01:14:29.360  --> 01:14:31.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
so now I can detect
the scent of the threads.


01:14:31.940  --> 01:14:34.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can take him on now!


01:14:36.060  --> 01:14:39.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's smarter than I thought.


01:14:39.310  --> 01:14:42.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He doesn't flinch in fear.


01:14:42.080  --> 01:14:45.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, not that it matters anyway.


01:14:52.300  --> 01:14:56.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, First Form!


01:14:56.220  --> 01:14:59.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Surface Slash!


01:15:27.250  --> 01:15:30.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No way! My sword!


01:15:50.480  --> 01:15:52.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Amazing!


01:15:52.400  --> 01:15:54.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's on a whole other level.


01:15:54.270  --> 01:15:56.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The force of his swing is in a different class.


01:15:56.230  --> 01:15:58.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We're as different as Heaven and Earth.


01:15:58.400  --> 01:16:02.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He slashed that
tough-as-nails monster like tofu.


01:16:02.240  --> 01:16:05.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!


01:16:07.000  --> 01:16:08.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who is this guy?


01:16:08.830  --> 01:16:11.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I still have goose bumps!


01:16:20.760  --> 01:16:22.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hold on a second!


01:16:22.340  --> 01:16:24.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Fight me, Mismatched Haori!


01:16:24.760  --> 01:16:27.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You beat that Twelve Kizuki!


01:16:27.560  --> 01:16:30.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And now, I'm going to beat you!
That's how I've drawn it up!


01:16:30.390  --> 01:16:32.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I can do that...


01:16:33.650  --> 01:16:37.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
that'll make me the most powerful of all!


01:16:37.030  --> 01:16:40.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Go back to training, fool.


01:16:42.950  --> 01:16:44.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What?


01:16:44.620  --> 01:16:47.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That was no Twelve Kizuki
or anything close to one.


01:16:47.660  --> 01:16:49.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Could you not even tell that?


01:16:49.700  --> 01:16:51.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Of course I could!


01:16:51.040  --> 01:16:54.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I never thought that scrub could be
one of the Twelve Kizuki, either!


01:16:54.670  --> 01:16:57.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It was Tanjiro who said
it was one of the Twelve Kizuki!


01:16:57.750  --> 01:17:01.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I only repeated what he said!


01:17:04.890  --> 01:17:07.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's going on? Did he just tie me up?


01:17:07.180  --> 01:17:08.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So quick!


01:17:08.680  --> 01:17:10.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This guy's so quick!


01:17:10.180  --> 01:17:12.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait, you! Come back here!


01:17:12.690  --> 01:17:17.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Stay out of battle
if you don't even realize how hurt you are.


01:17:18.440  --> 01:17:19.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't hear you!


01:17:19.610  --> 01:17:21.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your voice is too soft,
and you walk too fast!


01:17:21.940  --> 01:17:23.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I said hold up a second!


01:17:23.910  --> 01:17:25.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Untie these ropes right now!


01:17:25.660  --> 01:17:27.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey! Hey!


01:17:27.240  --> 01:17:31.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey!


01:17:47.600  --> 01:17:49.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hello there.


01:17:49.890  --> 01:17:51.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you all right?


01:17:53.640  --> 01:17:55.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Gramps...


01:17:56.400  --> 01:17:58.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who are you calling "Gramps"?


01:17:58.860  --> 01:18:05.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just now, Gramps showed up,
and told me not to give up.


01:18:05.360  --> 01:18:08.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You saw your life flashing
before your eyes.


01:18:08.240  --> 01:18:13.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
According to one theory, the reason
one sees such images just before death


01:18:13.120  --> 01:18:16.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
is because you're searching
for a way to avoid death


01:18:16.460  --> 01:18:20.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
by going through all your
past experiences and memories.


01:18:20.460  --> 01:18:25.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, not that I can say for sure,
since I've never experienced it myself.


01:18:27.550  --> 01:18:31.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right, you did a good job slowing down
the poison's path with your breathing.


01:18:31.970  --> 01:18:36.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you hadn't been able to do that,
you would've turned into a spider long ago.


01:18:36.560  --> 01:18:38.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll inject you with the antidote now, okay?


01:18:41.730  --> 01:18:44.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hurry! Over here, over here!


01:18:45.570  --> 01:18:47.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can we get them down?


01:18:47.160  --> 01:18:49.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Be careful, okay?


01:18:49.070  --> 01:18:51.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's all good. Everyone's still alive.


01:19:07.840  --> 01:19:10.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My sword's been broken.


01:19:10.050  --> 01:19:11.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't believe it.


01:19:11.850  --> 01:19:13.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The threads this boy is weaving...


01:19:13.840  --> 01:19:18.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are they even tougher than the body
of that demon I couldn't cut earlier?


01:19:19.270  --> 01:19:23.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Forgive me, Urokodaki and Haganezuka...


01:19:23.730  --> 01:19:28.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Due to my inexperience,
my sword is now broken.


01:19:29.780  --> 01:19:32.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No, this isn't the time for that!


01:19:32.410  --> 01:19:34.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Think! Think!


01:19:35.750  --> 01:19:39.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I can't cut those threads,
I'll get within reach instead!


01:19:45.340  --> 01:19:46.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's no good.


01:19:46.670  --> 01:19:50.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Those threads have a life of their own,
and I can't get through their attacks.


01:19:50.260  --> 01:19:55.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's even holding back not to kill me,
but he's overpowering me all the same.


01:19:57.230  --> 01:19:58.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well?


01:19:58.600  --> 01:20:02.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you still refuse to take back
what you said earlier?


01:20:04.730  --> 01:20:09.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Fine. You'll get slashed to ribbons.


01:20:10.360  --> 01:20:12.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't dodge this!


01:20:23.000  --> 01:20:24.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


01:20:28.210  --> 01:20:30.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko! Nezuko!


01:20:30.090  --> 01:20:33.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You protected me! I'm sorry!


01:20:33.340  --> 01:20:36.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A girl emerged from the box he carries.


01:20:36.760  --> 01:20:39.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, she seems to be a demon.


01:20:44.270  --> 01:20:47.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, you... Is that...


01:20:48.230  --> 01:20:50.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That girl...


01:20:50.700  --> 01:20:52.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is she your sibling?


01:20:52.450  --> 01:20:54.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So what if she is?


01:20:54.870  --> 01:20:56.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The wound's so deep.


01:20:56.740  --> 01:20:59.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Her left wrist is about to fall off.


01:21:01.040  --> 01:21:04.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hurry up and heal! Hurry up and heal!
Hurry up and heal!


01:21:05.420  --> 01:21:08.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Siblings... Siblings...


01:21:08.130  --> 01:21:10.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- The sister's been turned into a demon.
- Ru...


01:21:10.720  --> 01:21:13.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Yet, he is with her.
- Rui?


01:21:13.720  --> 01:21:16.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The sister protected her brother.


01:21:16.140  --> 01:21:17.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Risking her own life.


01:21:17.970  --> 01:21:20.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's a genuine bond.


01:21:20.520  --> 01:21:21.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want it!


01:21:21.680  --> 01:21:24.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
W-Wait a minute!


01:21:24.190  --> 01:21:26.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait a minute! Please!


01:21:26.400  --> 01:21:29.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm your elder sister!
Don't abandon me!


01:21:29.440  --> 01:21:30.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shut up!


01:21:42.080  --> 01:21:46.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
None of you ever managed
to fulfill the roles you were given.


01:21:46.830  --> 01:21:49.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Never. Not once.


01:21:49.500  --> 01:21:52.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
W-Wait.


01:21:52.130  --> 01:21:55.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, wasn't I the elder sister you wanted?


01:21:55.010  --> 01:21:56.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please let me make it up to you.


01:21:56.930  --> 01:22:02.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
In that case, go kill those people
wandering all over this mountain.


01:22:02.430  --> 01:22:06.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you do that, I'll forgive you
for what just happened.


01:22:06.440  --> 01:22:09.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
F-Fine.


01:22:09.110  --> 01:22:10.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll go kill them.


01:22:16.780  --> 01:22:18.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Boy...


01:22:19.030  --> 01:22:21.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Boy, let's talk.


01:22:21.700  --> 01:22:23.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on out.


01:22:24.290  --> 01:22:26.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Boy"?


01:22:26.170  --> 01:22:27.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Talk"?


01:22:28.580  --> 01:22:32.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The thing is, I was really moved.


01:22:32.130  --> 01:22:35.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seeing the bond you two share
gave me the chills.


01:22:35.840  --> 01:22:40.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I doubt there are any words in this universe
that can describe how moved I was.


01:22:40.470  --> 01:22:44.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
However, your fate now is death by my hand.


01:22:44.230  --> 01:22:47.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wouldn't that be too unfortunate, though?


01:22:50.480  --> 01:22:52.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, there's just one thing.


01:22:52.680  --> 01:22:56.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just one thing that will
let you escape that.


01:22:56.610  --> 01:22:59.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your sister...


01:22:59.620  --> 01:23:02.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Give your sister to me.


01:23:02.620  --> 01:23:06.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you hand her over without a fight,
I'll at least spare your life.


01:23:09.170  --> 01:23:12.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't understand what you're saying!


01:23:12.630  --> 01:23:17.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Starting today
your sister will be my sister.


01:23:18.380  --> 01:23:21.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You don't actually think
I'd ever agree to that.


01:23:21.890  --> 01:23:24.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not to mention, Nezuko's not a thing.


01:23:24.520  --> 01:23:27.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She has her own feelings and will.


01:23:27.390  --> 01:23:30.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's no way she'll ever be your sister.


01:23:30.900  --> 01:23:34.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's all right. No need to worry.


01:23:34.360  --> 01:23:36.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because I'll forge a bond.


01:23:36.610  --> 01:23:38.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm stronger than her.


01:23:38.990  --> 01:23:41.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm talking about the bond of terror.


01:23:41.070  --> 01:23:43.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll teach her what happens
when she disobeys.


01:23:43.740  --> 01:23:46.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've had enough of you
spouting this nonsense!


01:23:46.330  --> 01:23:50.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Using terror to shackle someone
hand and foot is not the bond of a family!


01:23:50.880  --> 01:23:56.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Until you fix that basic misunderstanding,
you'll never get what you desire!


01:23:57.590  --> 01:24:01.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So irritating.
Would you mind not shouting?


01:24:01.590  --> 01:24:04.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We don't see eye to eye, do we?


01:24:08.730  --> 01:24:12.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll never hand Nezuko over to you.


01:24:12.100  --> 01:24:15.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's okay, I guess.
I'll just kill you and then take her.


01:24:15.860  --> 01:24:19.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll cut off your head first!


01:24:19.200  --> 01:24:21.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's the spirit.


01:24:21.820  --> 01:24:24.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'd like to see you try it.


01:24:25.450  --> 01:24:30.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That is, if you can actually defeat
a Twelve Kizuki like me.


01:24:39.720  --> 01:24:41.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Family.


01:24:42.800  --> 01:24:46.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A father has his role as the father,


01:24:46.180  --> 01:24:50.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and the mother has
her role as the mother.


01:24:50.140  --> 01:24:52.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The parents protect the children,


01:24:52.980  --> 01:24:57.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and the elder brother and sister
protect their younger sibling.


01:24:57.440  --> 01:24:59.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No matter what.


01:25:00.360  --> 01:25:02.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
At the risk of their own lives.


01:25:02.910  --> 01:25:08.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The way I see it,
if you don't understand your own role,


01:25:08.240  --> 01:25:11.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
there's no reason for you to live.


01:25:12.290  --> 01:25:14.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What about you?


01:25:14.170  --> 01:25:16.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's your role?


01:25:17.550  --> 01:25:21.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your role is to give your sister
to me and disappear.


01:25:21.380  --> 01:25:24.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you can't do that,
your only option is to die.


01:25:24.970  --> 01:25:27.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because you can't defeat me.


01:25:28.930  --> 01:25:31.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Lower Five.


01:25:31.350  --> 01:25:32.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just as I thought.


01:25:32.600  --> 01:25:37.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That power...
He is a true Twelve Kizuki.


01:25:37.360  --> 01:25:39.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It won't be easy to cut those threads.


01:25:39.730  --> 01:25:43.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What should I do with this broken sword?


01:25:43.320  --> 01:25:46.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If his neck turns out
to be tougher than the threads...


01:25:46.700  --> 01:25:50.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't like that glittering in your eyes.


01:25:50.450  --> 01:25:52.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How foolish.


01:25:52.330  --> 01:25:56.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't tell me
you think you're going to win?


01:26:00.960  --> 01:26:02.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


01:26:03.470  --> 01:26:06.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There, I've taken her now.


01:26:06.470  --> 01:26:09.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now, do you understand your role?


01:26:09.140  --> 01:26:10.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let her go!


01:26:10.930  --> 01:26:15.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I told you I'd spare your life,
at least, if you didn't defy me.


01:26:26.450  --> 01:26:28.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko's gone!


01:26:35.710  --> 01:26:37.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


01:26:44.340  --> 01:26:45.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Quiet down.


01:26:45.970  --> 01:26:50.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sure that's not enough to kill her.
After all, she's a demon.


01:26:50.550  --> 01:26:53.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, it looks like I'll have to teach her
a lesson after all.


01:26:53.890  --> 01:26:56.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going to let her bleed for a while.


01:26:56.600  --> 01:26:59.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If she still doesn't learn to be obedient,


01:26:59.610  --> 01:27:02.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll just leave her like that until sunrise...


01:27:02.650  --> 01:27:04.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and let her get scorched a bit.


01:27:04.570  --> 01:27:08.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let Nezuko go!


01:27:30.800  --> 01:27:34.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Look, you...
I'm sure I'm mistaken, but...


01:27:34.970  --> 01:27:40.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You don't think that if you get close enough
to me, you can chop off my head, do you?


01:27:44.020  --> 01:27:47.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Fine by me. Here. Give it a shot.


01:27:54.790  --> 01:27:58.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The blade won't go through?


01:27:59.580  --> 01:28:02.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Didn't I tell you?


01:28:03.040  --> 01:28:06.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You have no chance against me.


01:28:12.760  --> 01:28:17.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My body is more durable
than any thread I manipulate.


01:28:17.730  --> 01:28:19.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you can't even cut those threads,


01:28:19.970  --> 01:28:22.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
you don't have a chance
of slashing my neck.


01:28:32.450  --> 01:28:34.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
S-So powerful.


01:28:34.910  --> 01:28:39.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
His power is on a whole different level
than any other demon I've fought.


01:28:39.330  --> 01:28:43.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, this is a Twelve Kizuki's...


01:28:43.040  --> 01:28:47.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is this the power of a demon
with a higher concentration of Kibutsuji's blood?


01:28:52.220  --> 01:28:54.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're making too much noise.


01:28:54.220  --> 01:28:55.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Quiet down a bit.


01:28:58.890  --> 01:29:00.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Stop that!


01:29:00.980  --> 01:29:03.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm your big brother now.


01:29:03.730  --> 01:29:06.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Enough of that infernal wailing.


01:29:08.150  --> 01:29:11.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Calm down! Don't get emotional!


01:29:11.820  --> 01:29:14.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you keep this up,
you'll be playing right into his hands.


01:29:18.830  --> 01:29:21.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did she pass out?


01:29:21.370  --> 01:29:23.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is she asleep?


01:29:23.670  --> 01:29:26.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This demon has a unique aura.


01:29:26.500  --> 01:29:30.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's something about her
that's not like the rest of us.


01:29:30.050  --> 01:29:31.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Interesting.


01:29:32.510  --> 01:29:34.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Concentrate!


01:29:34.180  --> 01:29:35.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Control my breathing!


01:29:35.970  --> 01:29:39.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Unleash the final form
with highest precision!


01:29:39.600  --> 01:29:42.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Total Concentration!


01:29:44.100  --> 01:29:47.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You still don't realize how futile it is?


01:29:51.320  --> 01:29:54.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Water Breathing, Tenth Form!


01:29:54.870  --> 01:29:58.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Constant Flux!


01:30:02.340  --> 01:30:04.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I did it! I cut the threads!


01:30:05.420  --> 01:30:08.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Gathering force with each rotation.


01:30:08.920  --> 01:30:11.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This could be trouble.


01:30:11.340  --> 01:30:12.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can do it!


01:30:12.670  --> 01:30:15.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I can keep closing
the distance between us, I can win!


01:30:18.850  --> 01:30:24.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, you don't think these threads
are at maximum strength, do you?


01:30:24.180  --> 01:30:27.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Blood Demon Art,
Cutting Thread Cage.


01:30:28.610  --> 01:30:30.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You are no longer of use for me.


01:30:30.770  --> 01:30:31.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Goodbye.


01:30:34.280  --> 01:30:37.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No! I can't slash these threads!


01:30:37.110  --> 01:30:39.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I haven't gotten enough rotations.


01:30:39.030  --> 01:30:42.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
These are giving off a totally different
scent than the other threads.


01:30:42.370  --> 01:30:45.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I can't afford to lose no matter what!


01:30:45.790  --> 01:30:48.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going to die.
I'm going to lose.


01:30:49.000  --> 01:30:50.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm...


01:31:15.070  --> 01:31:16.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Father?


01:31:18.860  --> 01:31:20.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro.


01:31:21.120  --> 01:31:23.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Breathe.


01:31:23.040  --> 01:31:27.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Control your breathing
and become like Hinokami.


01:31:37.220  --> 01:31:40.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro, look.


01:31:40.340  --> 01:31:43.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's your dad's kagura dance.


01:31:43.180  --> 01:31:45.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Our family works with fire,


01:31:45.850  --> 01:31:48.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
so to ward off injuries and disasters,


01:31:48.270  --> 01:31:54.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
we offer this dance to Hinokami,
along with our prayers, at the start of each year.


01:31:59.320  --> 01:32:01.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mother.


01:32:01.110  --> 01:32:02.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hm?


01:32:02.240  --> 01:32:09.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How can Father dance like that in the snow
for so long when he's so frail?


01:32:10.170  --> 01:32:14.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I bet my lungs would freeze.


01:32:16.710  --> 01:32:19.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's a way to breathe.


01:32:19.380  --> 01:32:23.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A way to breathe so that you won't exhaust
yourself, no matter how much you move.


01:32:23.100  --> 01:32:25.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Breathe?


01:32:25.100  --> 01:32:26.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right.


01:32:26.520  --> 01:32:32.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you master how to breathe properly,
you'll be able to dance forever too.


01:32:32.350  --> 01:32:35.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even the cold won't bother you.


01:32:36.190  --> 01:32:37.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro,


01:32:37.940  --> 01:32:41.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
if nothing else, I'll make sure
this kagura dance and these earrings


01:32:41.890  --> 01:32:45.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
get passed down to you uninterrupted.


01:32:45.660  --> 01:32:47.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's what I promised.


01:32:52.960  --> 01:32:55.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hinokami Kagura...


01:32:57.880  --> 01:32:59.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dance!


01:32:59.880  --> 01:33:01.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My threads...


01:33:06.140  --> 01:33:07.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't stop!


01:33:07.640  --> 01:33:09.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Keep running!


01:33:09.180  --> 01:33:10.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I stop now,


01:33:10.560  --> 01:33:12.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
it'll bring on the repercussions


01:33:12.570  --> 01:33:15.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
of forcibly switching from Water Breathing
to Hinokami Kagura Breathing!


01:33:15.610  --> 01:33:19.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If that happens,
I may not be able to move again.


01:33:20.610  --> 01:33:24.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's why I gotta do it now!


01:33:24.200  --> 01:33:25.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Run!


01:33:25.780  --> 01:33:27.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I gotta protect Nezuko!


01:33:35.920  --> 01:33:37.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This boy...


01:33:47.600  --> 01:33:50.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I see the Opening Thread!


01:33:50.520  --> 01:33:52.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I gotta take him down now!


01:33:52.640  --> 01:33:57.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if it means getting slashed
by him in the process!


01:33:59.400  --> 01:34:02.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko. Nezuko.


01:34:03.650  --> 01:34:06.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wake up, Nezuko.


01:34:06.990  --> 01:34:09.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You have to save your brother.


01:34:09.620  --> 01:34:12.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I know you can do it now, Nezuko.


01:34:13.120  --> 01:34:15.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do your best.


01:34:21.420  --> 01:34:24.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please, Nezuko.


01:34:24.090  --> 01:34:27.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Or your brother will be killed too.


01:34:30.600  --> 01:34:32.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Blood Demon Art...


01:34:34.100  --> 01:34:35.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Exploding Blood!


01:34:45.030  --> 01:34:46.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Impossible!


01:34:46.320  --> 01:34:48.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My threads were burned away?


01:34:48.570  --> 01:34:53.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The bond between Nezuko and me
cannot be...


01:34:53.410  --> 01:34:55.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
severed by anyone!


01:35:05.160  --> 01:35:11.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If there is nothing but this fate for me,


01:35:11.500  --> 01:35:18.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I will be prepared for it


01:35:18.020  --> 01:35:24.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if I struggle
and claw through the mud


01:35:24.160  --> 01:35:31.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's a thin thread that can't be seen


01:35:31.600  --> 01:35:42.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And a tender sound
that makes you want to cry


01:35:44.230  --> 01:35:49.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No matter the frustration


01:35:49.410  --> 01:36:01.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Go forward, keep facing ahead,
cut away the despair


01:36:01.970  --> 01:36:14.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even with all the pain,
I have no choice but to stand up again


01:36:15.880  --> 01:36:28.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No matter how devastated I am,
there are things to protect


01:36:28.460  --> 01:36:34.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There are things to protect


01:36:54.370  --> 01:36:56.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko.


01:36:56.370  --> 01:36:58.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


01:37:00.600  --> 01:37:02.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won.


01:37:02.170  --> 01:37:03.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won!


01:37:04.500  --> 01:37:06.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Father saved me.


01:37:07.750  --> 01:37:10.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not sure how I was able
to unleash that attack


01:37:10.420  --> 01:37:13.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
with the kagura dance that's been
in our family for generations.


01:37:13.300  --> 01:37:16.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, that saved me.


01:37:16.260  --> 01:37:18.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was able to beat him.


01:37:22.690  --> 01:37:24.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Huh?


01:37:24.440  --> 01:37:27.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't see Nezuko.


01:37:27.190  --> 01:37:30.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is it because I was reckless
with my breathing?


01:37:33.320  --> 01:37:35.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This ringing in my ears is brutal.


01:37:35.700  --> 01:37:38.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My whole body is throbbing with pain.


01:37:40.290  --> 01:37:44.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I must recover fast.


01:37:45.710  --> 01:37:49.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm still not done fighting.


01:37:49.960  --> 01:37:52.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I gotta go help Inosuke.


01:37:52.970  --> 01:37:54.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right away!


01:37:58.470  --> 01:38:01.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The scent of blood just got stronger?


01:38:01.770  --> 01:38:06.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come to think of it,
there was no smell of ash.


01:38:07.270  --> 01:38:08.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't tell me...


01:38:12.320  --> 01:38:14.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even though I took his head off?


01:38:15.280  --> 01:38:17.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You thought you'd defeated me?


01:38:17.820  --> 01:38:19.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Poor kid.


01:38:19.660  --> 01:38:23.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did your pathetic delusion
bring you joy?


01:38:23.370  --> 01:38:27.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I cut my own head off
with my threads


01:38:27.380  --> 01:38:30.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
before you could cut it off.


01:38:31.590  --> 01:38:33.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Enough.


01:38:33.130  --> 01:38:36.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll kill both you and your sister.


01:38:36.090  --> 01:38:40.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I haven't been this enraged in a long time.


01:38:40.390  --> 01:38:41.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Get up!


01:38:41.810  --> 01:38:43.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Get up right now!


01:38:43.850  --> 01:38:45.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Get your breathing under control!


01:38:45.890  --> 01:38:46.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hurry!


01:38:46.980  --> 01:38:48.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right now!


01:38:48.520  --> 01:38:52.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I wonder how you didn't get burned.


01:38:53.030  --> 01:38:56.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My threads and I were the only things
that were set ablaze.


01:38:56.280  --> 01:39:01.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't know if it's your sister's power,
but thanks for getting me enraged.


01:39:03.040  --> 01:39:07.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now I can carve you up without regret.


01:39:08.210  --> 01:39:12.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
As long as I breathe correctly,
it won't matter how exhausted I am.


01:39:13.590  --> 01:39:16.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Blood Demon Art, Murderous Eye Basket.


01:39:19.510  --> 01:39:20.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't panic!


01:39:20.930  --> 01:39:22.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't let it disrupt your breathing!


01:39:22.600  --> 01:39:25.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Calm down. I have to stay calm!


01:39:26.640  --> 01:39:29.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't raise my arm.


01:39:42.200  --> 01:39:44.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Somebody's here.


01:39:44.490  --> 01:39:46.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is it Zenitsu?


01:39:48.540  --> 01:39:51.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You did a good job holding out
until I got here.


01:39:53.800  --> 01:39:55.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Leave the rest to me.


01:39:57.760  --> 01:39:59.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're like an endless stream


01:39:59.970  --> 01:40:03.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
of lowlifes, always getting in my way!


01:40:03.300  --> 01:40:05.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Blood Demon Art.


01:40:10.350  --> 01:40:12.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cutting Thread Rotation!


01:40:14.190  --> 01:40:17.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Total Concentration, Water Breathing,


01:40:17.740  --> 01:40:19.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Eleventh Form.


01:40:21.490  --> 01:40:22.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dead Calm.


01:40:23.580  --> 01:40:25.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Eleventh Form"?


01:40:25.700  --> 01:40:28.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who cares about your Eleventh Form?


01:40:31.080  --> 01:40:32.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What?


01:40:34.670  --> 01:40:37.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's going on? What did he do?


01:40:37.760  --> 01:40:42.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The instant the threads got near him,
they scattered.


01:40:42.930  --> 01:40:45.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not a single one reached him?


01:40:45.760  --> 01:40:49.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The toughest threads of all got slashed?


01:40:49.430  --> 01:40:51.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That cannot be!


01:40:51.520  --> 01:40:53.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll try it again!


01:41:02.860  --> 01:41:06.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I messed up! I messed up!


01:41:20.880  --> 01:41:22.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Drink this.


01:41:22.180  --> 01:41:26.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Each of our family members' abilities
are thanks to Rui.


01:41:27.180  --> 01:41:32.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Since we were all weak demons,
Rui shared his power with us.


01:41:32.100  --> 01:41:38.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because Rui is the Master's favorite,
he gets special permission to do this.


01:41:47.870  --> 01:41:49.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you feel it?


01:41:49.990  --> 01:41:53.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You don't have to fear
those Demon Slayers anymore.


01:41:54.710  --> 01:41:58.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now then, time for the finishing touches.


01:42:11.470  --> 01:42:14.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right, you can look up now.


01:42:17.690  --> 01:42:19.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Congratulations.


01:42:19.520  --> 01:42:22.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're truly part of the family now.


01:42:54.100  --> 01:42:56.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We're only playing house.


01:42:56.770  --> 01:42:57.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What?


01:42:57.600  --> 01:42:59.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We have no blood ties.


01:42:59.770  --> 01:43:02.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We're just a clan of assorted strangers.


01:43:02.110  --> 01:43:04.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm so sorry!


01:43:04.030  --> 01:43:06.360 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll do better, Rui!


01:43:06.360  --> 01:43:09.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll practice! Forgive me!


01:43:09.030  --> 01:43:12.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry that I'm not very good!


01:43:12.580  --> 01:43:15.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's just that I revert
by accident sometimes!


01:43:24.630  --> 01:43:27.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't want to hear
your excuses, Mother.


01:43:30.470  --> 01:43:33.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just play the role of mother like you should.


01:43:33.220  --> 01:43:36.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I understand, Rui.


01:43:38.060  --> 01:43:42.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We were all so scared of the Demon Slayers
and sought companionship.


01:43:44.440  --> 01:43:50.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's not like we wanted to take part
in this baffling "Pretend Family" game.


01:43:50.200  --> 01:43:54.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, those who fail to go along
with Rui's demands and orders


01:43:54.080  --> 01:43:57.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
get carved up or have their intellect
taken from them


01:43:57.750  --> 01:44:00.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
or get strung up, exposed to sunlight.


01:44:00.750  --> 01:44:02.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've had enough of this.


01:44:04.090  --> 01:44:07.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going to pretend
I never heard you say thatâ


01:44:07.010  --> 01:44:10.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I know you're not a fool.


01:44:10.050  --> 01:44:12.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Unlike all the others.


01:44:13.890  --> 01:44:15.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's run away together.


01:44:17.930  --> 01:44:21.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I wouldn't say this to anyone but you.


01:44:21.020  --> 01:44:26.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're the one person
I truly think of as my younger sister.


01:44:33.320  --> 01:44:38.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tomorrow, Rui will be summoned by the Master
and head down the mountain.


01:44:38.750  --> 01:44:41.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's our chance to escape.


01:45:16.910  --> 01:45:19.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How disappointing.


01:45:42.230  --> 01:45:45.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They were all fools, but I am not.


01:45:45.690  --> 01:45:48.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even so, I messed up.


01:45:51.360  --> 01:45:54.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rui! Rui!


01:45:54.070  --> 01:45:56.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mother's been killed.


01:45:56.070  --> 01:45:58.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And perhaps our elder brother too.


01:45:58.580  --> 01:46:00.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What should we do?


01:46:00.200  --> 01:46:02.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The Demon Slayers aren't far behind.


01:46:04.080  --> 01:46:05.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Listen...


01:46:07.010  --> 01:46:10.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shouldn't we make a run for it?


01:46:11.590  --> 01:46:13.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't...


01:46:15.430  --> 01:46:18.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You know, don't you?


01:46:18.180  --> 01:46:22.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I really hate it when your face reverts.


01:46:26.020  --> 01:46:27.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you looking at?


01:46:27.980  --> 01:46:30.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This isn't some show, you know.


01:46:32.860  --> 01:46:37.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I only got my face slashed,
so I got off easy.


01:46:38.870  --> 01:46:39.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A demon!


01:46:43.080  --> 01:46:44.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What?


01:46:46.170  --> 01:46:49.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's no use.
You'll never cut through them.


01:46:49.000  --> 01:46:53.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You see, my balls of yarn may feel soft,
but it's extremely durable.


01:46:55.680  --> 01:47:00.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
First, the solvent will melt
those clothes out of the way.


01:47:00.260  --> 01:47:02.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And then, it'll be your turn.


01:47:02.520  --> 01:47:07.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You'll be reduced to mush in no time,
and then you'll be my meal.


01:47:07.150  --> 01:47:09.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How amazing!


01:47:09.020  --> 01:47:11.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you spin those threads
from the palms of your hands?


01:47:13.030  --> 01:47:14.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Good evening.


01:47:15.530  --> 01:47:18.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The moon is quite lovely tonight, isn't it?


01:47:31.960  --> 01:47:36.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can see you have no intention
of getting along with me.


01:47:36.090  --> 01:47:39.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
W-W-Wait!


01:47:39.010  --> 01:47:40.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please!


01:47:40.090  --> 01:47:43.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm being forced to do this.


01:47:43.810  --> 01:47:46.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I defy him, I'll be slashed to pieces.


01:47:47.980  --> 01:47:51.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is that really true?
That does sound tragic.


01:47:51.690  --> 01:47:53.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll help you.


01:47:53.150  --> 01:47:54.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's be friends.


01:47:54.940  --> 01:47:58.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Y-You'll help me?


01:47:58.030  --> 01:48:01.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes! But, in order for us to be friends,


01:48:01.370  --> 01:48:04.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I must ask you a few questions.


01:48:05.330  --> 01:48:10.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My sweet little girl,
how many people have you killed?


01:48:11.500  --> 01:48:12.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Five.


01:48:16.550  --> 01:48:20.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I was ordered to.
I had no choice.


01:48:20.300  --> 01:48:23.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's no need to lie about it.


01:48:23.350  --> 01:48:25.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because I already know.


01:48:25.390  --> 01:48:29.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- How you cocooned up one of our men
- Somebody, help me!


01:48:29.230  --> 01:48:30.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- was most impressive.
- Somebody, help me!


01:48:30.900  --> 01:48:33.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You've eaten at least 80 humans,
haven't you?


01:48:33.730  --> 01:48:35.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Of course not.
I haven't eaten that many.


01:48:35.980  --> 01:48:38.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've only killed five.


01:48:38.400  --> 01:48:41.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I came here from the west, you know.


01:48:41.990  --> 01:48:44.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The west, dear little girl.


01:48:44.910  --> 01:48:46.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
On the west side of the mountain,


01:48:46.960  --> 01:48:50.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I saw hordes of cocoons
hanging from the trees.


01:48:50.790  --> 01:48:55.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The human captives inside
had been liquefied and massacred.


01:48:55.920  --> 01:49:00.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I counted at least 14 cocoons
in that spot alone.


01:49:00.930  --> 01:49:04.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Fourteen humans are dead.


01:49:04.430  --> 01:49:07.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's not that I'm angry.


01:49:07.270  --> 01:49:11.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm only trying
to confirm the accurate toll.


01:49:11.190  --> 01:49:13.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What good will it do you
to confirm that?


01:49:13.940  --> 01:49:18.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You'll receive the punishment
you deserve and be reborn.


01:49:18.860  --> 01:49:19.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Punishment?


01:49:19.940  --> 01:49:23.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That way, you and I
can become friends.


01:49:23.200  --> 01:49:27.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you go unpunished
after having taken all those lives,


01:49:27.120  --> 01:49:29.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
your victims will never receive justice.


01:49:30.370  --> 01:49:32.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I could gouge out your eyeballs...


01:49:32.620  --> 01:49:36.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
or cut open your stomach
and pull out your guts.


01:49:36.630  --> 01:49:41.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I shall torture you
for every person you've killed.


01:49:41.720  --> 01:49:45.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And after you've suffered
through all of the pain and agony,


01:49:45.620  --> 01:49:48.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
your sins will be forgiven.


01:49:48.140  --> 01:49:50.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's both give it our all.


01:49:50.890  --> 01:49:52.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't worry!


01:49:52.350  --> 01:49:54.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Since you're a demon,


01:49:54.150  --> 01:49:57.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
surely it won't kill you and neither
will there be any lingering effects!


01:49:57.900  --> 01:50:00.230 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who do you think you're kidding?


01:50:00.230  --> 01:50:02.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Die, you wicked woman!


01:50:09.910  --> 01:50:13.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can see that we'll never be friends.


01:50:14.040  --> 01:50:16.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh, what a pity.


01:50:53.580  --> 01:50:56.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Insect Breathing, Butterfly Dance.


01:50:57.790  --> 01:50:59.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Caprice.


01:51:01.300  --> 01:51:04.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My head hasn't been cut off?


01:51:05.880  --> 01:51:08.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's the sword she's using?


01:51:08.050  --> 01:51:09.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I see.


01:51:09.470  --> 01:51:12.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Her body's small,
and she has no arm strength,


01:51:12.010  --> 01:51:14.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
so she can't behead me.


01:51:14.140  --> 01:51:16.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can win this.


01:51:35.450  --> 01:51:40.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You mustn't think you're safe
just because you haven't been beheaded.


01:51:40.210  --> 01:51:43.920 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because there are those like me
who use poison.


01:51:49.390  --> 01:51:54.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I am Insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho,
from Demon Slayer Corps.


01:51:54.060  --> 01:51:59.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I may be the only one among the Hashira
unable to decapitate demons,


01:51:59.480  --> 01:52:04.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
but I've created a poison lethal to demons.
That's quite impressive, isn't it?


01:52:04.940  --> 01:52:07.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh! Pardon me!


01:52:07.320  --> 01:52:10.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're dead,
so you can't hear me, can you?


01:52:10.320  --> 01:52:12.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My bad.


01:52:18.960  --> 01:52:21.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you all right?


01:52:21.830  --> 01:52:23.420 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just barely.


01:52:23.420  --> 01:52:26.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What happened to the demon?


01:52:27.470  --> 01:52:30.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shouldn't you finish it off?


01:52:30.590  --> 01:52:33.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I killed her with wisteria poison.


01:52:33.390  --> 01:52:37.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She's already dead,
so we can leave her to rot.


01:52:37.350  --> 01:52:41.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm an expert in pharmaceutics.


01:52:41.020  --> 01:52:45.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your clothes were dissolved,
but your body is more or less unscathed.


01:52:45.070  --> 01:52:46.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Isn't that good?


01:52:50.280  --> 01:52:51.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now then,


01:52:51.540  --> 01:52:56.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
as for the whereabouts of the demon
that forced this girl to do his bidding...


01:52:57.790  --> 01:53:01.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did Tomioka beat me to it, then?


01:53:01.710  --> 01:53:03.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko.


01:53:03.170  --> 01:53:04.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


01:53:07.300  --> 01:53:09.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll kill them! I'll kill them!


01:53:09.840  --> 01:53:13.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll kill those siblings no matter what!


01:53:13.090  --> 01:53:15.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Siblings!


01:53:18.140  --> 01:53:21.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is it that you want to do, Rui?


01:53:21.140  --> 01:53:23.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What do you mean by "family"?


01:53:24.270  --> 01:53:25.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't know.


01:53:25.900  --> 01:53:30.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because I have no memories
of when I was human.


01:53:30.280  --> 01:53:35.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is that why you made us
pretend to be your family?


01:53:35.450  --> 01:53:41.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I thought that if I could feel a family bond,
my memories would come back.


01:53:42.250  --> 01:53:45.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The bond of a real family...


01:53:50.970  --> 01:53:52.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's right.


01:53:52.840  --> 01:53:54.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I...


01:53:57.390  --> 01:53:59.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko.


01:54:52.990  --> 01:54:55.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rui! Rui!


01:54:56.550  --> 01:54:57.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rui!


01:54:57.660  --> 01:54:59.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you doing?


01:54:59.580  --> 01:55:02.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're not supposed to be outside.


01:55:05.790  --> 01:55:10.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was always very frail
ever since I was born.


01:55:11.460  --> 01:55:13.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I couldn't run.


01:55:14.260  --> 01:55:17.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even just walking was a struggle.


01:55:22.220  --> 01:55:25.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Until Master Muzan appeared.


01:55:29.060  --> 01:55:34.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You poor thing. I shall save you.


01:55:38.740  --> 01:55:41.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My parents weren't happy about it.


01:55:44.660  --> 01:55:47.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because now that I'd acquired
a strong body,


01:55:47.710  --> 01:55:50.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I could never expose myself to sunlight,


01:55:50.170  --> 01:55:53.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and I had to feed on humans.


01:55:58.090  --> 01:56:00.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What have you done?


01:56:00.140  --> 01:56:02.390 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What on earth have you done?


01:56:02.390  --> 01:56:03.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rui!


01:56:10.980  --> 01:56:15.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Long ago, I heard an incredible story.


01:56:18.240  --> 01:56:23.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There was once a father who died
trying to save his drowning child.


01:56:29.500  --> 01:56:31.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was deeply moved.


01:56:31.500  --> 01:56:35.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Such astounding parental love.
And such a bond, as well.


01:56:36.210  --> 01:56:41.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This father who drowned in the river
had truly fulfilled his role as a parent.


01:56:42.340  --> 01:56:44.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And yet,


01:56:44.180  --> 01:56:47.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
for some reason, my own parents...


01:56:52.400  --> 01:56:57.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My own parents tried to kill me


01:56:58.610  --> 01:57:00.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All my mother did was weep,


01:57:00.610  --> 01:57:03.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
never lifting a finger to protect me
as I was about to be killed.


01:57:17.670  --> 01:57:20.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Our bond must've been fake.


01:57:21.180  --> 01:57:25.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Our family bond wasn't real.


01:57:26.890  --> 01:57:30.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry...


01:57:32.190  --> 01:57:34.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She's saying something.


01:57:34.900  --> 01:57:36.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, she's still alive?


01:57:36.900  --> 01:57:43.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
...for not giving you a strong,
healthy body. I'm so sorry.


01:57:44.780  --> 01:57:49.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Those were my mother's last words


01:57:50.580  --> 01:57:52.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
before she died.


01:57:53.370  --> 01:57:55.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's all right, Rui.


01:57:55.960  --> 01:57:59.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We're going to die with you.


01:57:59.460  --> 01:58:02.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
At first I didn't understand what he said


01:58:02.050  --> 01:58:05.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
because I was enraged
that he'd tried to kill me.


01:58:05.050  --> 01:58:11.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, that moment I realized
that he meant to die with me


01:58:12.310  --> 01:58:16.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
to atone for my sin
of having murdered another.


01:58:22.150  --> 01:58:29.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That night, I severed our genuine bond
with my own hands.


01:58:30.410  --> 01:58:31.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even so,


01:58:32.580  --> 01:58:37.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Master Muzan tried to cheer me up.


01:58:37.250  --> 01:58:42.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It was all your parents' fault
for refusing to accept you.


01:58:42.050  --> 01:58:45.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take pride in your own strength.


01:58:45.800  --> 01:58:49.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I had no other choice
but to look at it that way.


01:58:49.890  --> 01:58:53.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I couldn't bear the weight
of what I'd done.


01:58:56.650  --> 01:59:00.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even knowing that I only had
myself to blame...


01:59:08.490  --> 01:59:10.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Every single day...


01:59:10.910  --> 01:59:14.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I missed my parents so much
I could barely stand it.


01:59:15.500  --> 01:59:20.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even after creating a fake family,
the emptiness remained.


01:59:20.500  --> 01:59:23.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Since I was the one
with the most power,


01:59:23.630  --> 01:59:27.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
there was no one
who could protect me.


01:59:27.510  --> 01:59:30.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The more powerful I became...


01:59:30.510  --> 01:59:34.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
the more my human memories faded.


01:59:34.270  --> 01:59:39.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And, I was losing sight
of what it was that I wanted to do.


01:59:47.740  --> 01:59:51.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seeking a bond
that I could never claim for myself.


01:59:51.740  --> 01:59:56.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I couldn't ever reach
no matter I stretch my hands out.


02:00:07.340  --> 02:00:09.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This small body...


02:00:09.800  --> 02:00:14.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
is giving off the scent of a grief
too overwhelming to bear.


02:00:31.620  --> 02:00:33.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So warm.


02:00:33.780  --> 02:00:37.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hands as gentle as sunlight.


02:00:40.370  --> 02:00:43.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now I remember as clear as day.


02:00:43.710  --> 02:00:46.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What I wanted was to apologize.


02:00:46.300  --> 02:00:48.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry.


02:00:48.470  --> 02:00:52.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was... I was to blame for it all.


02:00:53.930  --> 02:00:57.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please forgive me.


02:00:57.310  --> 02:01:03.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, since I've killed mountains of people,
I'm going to Hell, aren't I?


02:01:04.650  --> 02:01:10.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can't go to the same place
as Father and Mother, can I?


02:01:12.360  --> 02:01:14.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's not true.


02:01:15.910  --> 02:01:19.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We'll be going together even if it's to Hell.


02:01:24.210  --> 02:01:25.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rui.


02:01:26.920  --> 02:01:28.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Father.


02:01:29.720  --> 02:01:31.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mother.


02:01:32.430  --> 02:01:34.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rui.


02:01:34.180  --> 02:01:37.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We'll always be with you.


02:01:46.730  --> 02:01:50.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It was all my fault.


02:01:50.780  --> 02:01:52.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry!


02:01:53.200  --> 02:01:55.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry!


02:01:55.070  --> 02:01:59.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!


02:02:20.770  --> 02:02:24.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't waste any sympathy on a demon
that devoured humans.


02:02:24.350  --> 02:02:27.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It doesn't matter if it looks like a child.


02:02:27.900  --> 02:02:32.320 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's still a hideous monster
that's lived for decades.


02:02:32.320  --> 02:02:36.030 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
To avenge the people who were killed...


02:02:36.030  --> 02:02:39.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and to make sure
there are no more victims...


02:02:39.080  --> 02:02:44.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
of course, I'll bring my blade down
on any demon's neck without mercy.


02:02:44.080  --> 02:02:47.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, as for those for whom
being a demon meant despair,


02:02:47.810  --> 02:02:50.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
those who regretted their own actions...


02:02:50.380  --> 02:02:52.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I will never trample over them.


02:02:52.960  --> 02:02:55.380 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because demons were once human too.


02:02:56.260  --> 02:02:59.970 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They were human... like me.


02:02:59.970  --> 02:03:03.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please move your foot!


02:03:04.230  --> 02:03:06.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're not hideous monsters at all.


02:03:06.850  --> 02:03:09.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Demons are hopeless creatures.


02:03:09.650  --> 02:03:11.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're tragic creatures.


02:03:24.410  --> 02:03:26.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're...


02:03:34.260  --> 02:03:35.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh my...


02:03:40.050  --> 02:03:43.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why would you get in my way, Tomioka?


02:03:44.140  --> 02:03:47.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
After telling me that we could never
get along with demons...


02:03:47.980  --> 02:03:50.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How should I put this?


02:03:50.610  --> 02:03:55.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's exactly why no one likes you.


02:04:12.670  --> 02:04:16.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Man, this antidote
of Lady Kocho's is effective!


02:04:16.800  --> 02:04:21.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Indeed, and she prepares it
after a mere glance at the situation.


02:04:21.930  --> 02:04:24.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She's truly amazing.


02:04:24.310  --> 02:04:26.480 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That goes for him too.


02:04:26.480  --> 02:04:29.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because he defeated the demon,


02:04:29.250  --> 02:04:32.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
it slowed the circulation
of the poison just a bit.


02:04:32.690  --> 02:04:35.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
(TREATED)
All right! This should do it!


02:04:35.940  --> 02:04:37.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Looking good!


02:04:37.820  --> 02:04:40.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Chances are, they'll all pull through.


02:04:48.330  --> 02:04:51.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now, Tomioka, please move out of the way.


02:04:53.880  --> 02:04:55.460 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not...


02:04:55.960  --> 02:04:58.130 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not disliked by people.


02:05:01.930  --> 02:05:04.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, I'm sorry.


02:05:04.350  --> 02:05:07.140 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seems that you hadn't realized
that people don't like you.


02:05:07.140  --> 02:05:10.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I shouldn't have said anything.
My apologies.


02:05:15.770  --> 02:05:17.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Young boy.


02:05:17.190  --> 02:05:18.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes!


02:05:18.110  --> 02:05:20.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What you're protecting there is a demon.


02:05:20.950  --> 02:05:23.490 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't want you to get hurt,
so please move away.


02:05:23.490  --> 02:05:25.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Y-You're mistaken!


02:05:25.660  --> 02:05:28.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I mean, you're not mistaken, but...


02:05:28.540  --> 02:05:30.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
she's my little sister!


02:05:30.080  --> 02:05:32.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She's my little sister, so...
You see...


02:05:33.880  --> 02:05:37.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is that true? Poor soul...


02:05:37.550  --> 02:05:38.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
In that case,


02:05:38.510  --> 02:05:44.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I shall use a gentle poison to kill her
so she won't suffer.


02:05:46.640  --> 02:05:48.810 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can you move?


02:05:49.470  --> 02:05:52.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Make yourself move even if you can't move.


02:05:52.520  --> 02:05:54.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take your sister and run.


02:05:54.690  --> 02:05:56.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tomioka...


02:05:56.940  --> 02:05:58.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry for the trouble.


02:05:58.690  --> 02:06:00.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thank you very much!


02:06:02.200  --> 02:06:05.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Isn't that against the Corps rules?


02:06:16.880  --> 02:06:20.010 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My whole body is aching! It's so painful!


02:06:20.010  --> 02:06:21.630 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want to scream from the pain!


02:06:21.630  --> 02:06:22.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, I must endure it!


02:06:23.430  --> 02:06:26.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Endure! Endure! Endure! Endure!


02:06:30.720  --> 02:06:34.890 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Does this mean I'll have to leave
the Demon Slayer Corps?


02:06:34.890  --> 02:06:37.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if she's my sister,


02:06:37.020  --> 02:06:40.650 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
there's no way they'd let one of their
swordsmen travel with a demon.


02:06:44.450  --> 02:06:47.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I see you're dead serious, Tomioka.


02:06:47.160  --> 02:06:50.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who would've thought
a Hashira would ever defend a demon?


02:06:53.410  --> 02:06:55.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Whether you're dead serious or not,


02:06:55.440  --> 02:06:59.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not going to join you
in stalling for time.


02:06:59.250  --> 02:07:02.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, good day to you.


02:07:12.720  --> 02:07:15.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is that your attempt
at catching up with me?


02:07:23.440  --> 02:07:27.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't mind you trying to stop me,


02:07:27.110  --> 02:07:30.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
but don't forget about the other one.


02:07:37.370  --> 02:07:39.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't stop running!


02:07:39.000  --> 02:07:40.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Keep moving!


02:07:40.790  --> 02:07:43.590 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I must run as far away as I can!


02:07:50.720  --> 02:07:51.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No!


02:07:51.850  --> 02:07:53.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What happened?


02:07:53.220  --> 02:07:56.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It was all I could do to just keep running.


02:07:56.100  --> 02:07:57.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko!


02:07:58.560  --> 02:07:59.900 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A Demon Slayer?


02:08:05.400  --> 02:08:07.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Run, Nezuko!


02:08:07.740  --> 02:08:09.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Run! Make a run for it!


02:08:09.780  --> 02:08:11.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't get caught no matter what!


02:08:11.280  --> 02:08:12.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hurryâ


02:08:22.920  --> 02:08:25.670 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She shrunk and turned into a child.


02:08:34.930  --> 02:08:38.310 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She's just running away
without attacking me.


02:08:38.310  --> 02:08:39.600 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why?


02:08:42.810  --> 02:08:44.820 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No need to ponder.


02:08:44.820  --> 02:08:47.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My only job is to slay demons as I was told.


02:08:50.490  --> 02:08:52.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tomioka...


02:08:52.240  --> 02:08:55.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you listening, Tomioka?


02:08:55.200  --> 02:08:59.210 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Since my attack was to slay a demon,
and therefore justified,


02:08:59.210  --> 02:09:01.960 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't believe it could be
construed as a violation.


02:09:01.960  --> 02:09:05.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, what you're doing
is against the Corps rules.


02:09:05.840  --> 02:09:08.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're preventing me
from slaying a demon.


02:09:08.880  --> 02:09:11.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just what are your intentions here?


02:09:14.220  --> 02:09:17.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't you have anything to say?


02:09:17.180  --> 02:09:19.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This is your final warning.


02:09:19.350  --> 02:09:21.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Give me a reason at least.


02:09:27.530  --> 02:09:30.740 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
As I recall, it was two years ago.


02:09:30.740  --> 02:09:34.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please don't start some long, rambling
story from that far back in time.


02:09:34.530  --> 02:09:36.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you just being spiteful?


02:09:36.280  --> 02:09:40.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you perhaps still angry
that I pointed out how people don't like you?


02:09:45.130  --> 02:09:48.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Message! Message!


02:09:48.590  --> 02:09:50.840 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I have a message from headquarters!


02:09:51.380  --> 02:09:56.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro and Nezuko are to be taken into custody
and brought back to headquarters!


02:09:59.060  --> 02:10:02.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro and the demon, Nezuko,


02:10:02.180  --> 02:10:04.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
are to be taken into custody
and brought back to headquarters!


02:10:04.980  --> 02:10:10.570 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori,
with a scar on his forehead!


02:10:10.570  --> 02:10:13.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko, a demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!


02:10:13.200  --> 02:10:17.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Bring them back! Bring them back!
- Are you Nezuko?


02:10:20.910  --> 02:10:24.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bring them back! Bring them back!


02:10:24.540  --> 02:10:29.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori,
with a scar on his forehead!


02:10:29.050  --> 02:10:32.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nezuko, a demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!


02:10:32.550  --> 02:10:35.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bring them back! Bring them back!


02:10:39.010  --> 02:10:40.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He has a scar on his forehead.


02:10:40.640  --> 02:10:42.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right, take him into custody.


02:10:42.930  --> 02:10:46.860 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Look. His jaw seems
to be broken, doesn't it?


02:10:47.690  --> 02:10:49.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I feel bad about tying him up.


02:10:53.440  --> 02:10:55.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wh-Who the hell is this?


02:10:55.530  --> 02:10:56.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't know.


02:10:56.530  --> 02:10:58.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A demon? Couldn't be, right?


02:10:58.830  --> 02:11:01.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is it a human?


02:11:01.200  --> 02:11:04.170 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's wearing our uniform trousers.


02:11:04.170  --> 02:11:07.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh hey, this is a mask! He's a human!


02:11:07.710  --> 02:11:10.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
All right, let's bring him in.


02:11:11.710  --> 02:11:14.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This guy's been beaten up really bad!


02:11:14.340  --> 02:11:16.720 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why is he strung up like this?


02:11:19.010  --> 02:11:21.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There was nothing I could do.


02:11:22.560  --> 02:11:27.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I couldn't bring down
a single demon on my own.


02:11:29.110  --> 02:11:33.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Maybe I'm not that strong.


02:11:41.740  --> 02:11:45.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They wrapped us all up.


02:11:45.000  --> 02:11:47.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who are these people?


02:11:47.290  --> 02:11:50.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They're cleaning up this place
really efficiently.


02:11:50.750  --> 02:11:52.710 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And that girl there...


02:11:52.710  --> 02:11:55.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Isn't she the girl from Final Selection?


02:11:55.550  --> 02:12:00.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
She has the same kind of hairpin
as the lady who wrapped us up.


02:12:00.260  --> 02:12:02.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Should we bring them
to the Butterfly Mansion, as well?


02:12:02.060  --> 02:12:04.850 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes, bring all of the wounded to our place.


02:12:04.850  --> 02:12:07.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll be hunting down
the demons in the area,


02:12:07.080  --> 02:12:09.270 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
so you can work without any worries.


02:12:09.270  --> 02:12:11.940 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come to think of it,
I've heard about them.


02:12:11.940  --> 02:12:14.610 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The cleanup crew, the Kakushi.


02:12:14.610  --> 02:12:18.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The unit that cleans up after
the Demon Slayer Corps battles demons.


02:12:19.280  --> 02:12:25.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They say that most of its members
are people who lack sword skills.


02:12:32.000  --> 02:12:33.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's daybreak.


02:13:18.880  --> 02:13:21.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wake up.


02:13:21.090  --> 02:13:23.510 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, I said, "Wake up"!


02:13:23.510  --> 02:13:26.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wake... Hey! Hey you!


02:13:26.930  --> 02:13:29.350 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on, you! Come on!


02:13:29.350  --> 02:13:31.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you going to sleep all day?


02:13:31.100  --> 02:13:33.060 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wake up already, will you?


02:13:37.070  --> 02:13:39.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're in the presence of the Hashira!


02:13:44.190  --> 02:13:50.560 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now I know why I can be strong


02:13:50.560  --> 02:13:58.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take me with you and keep moving forward


02:14:01.890  --> 02:14:07.640 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Reeling from the sight of my grim past


02:14:07.640  --> 02:14:09.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My heart stiffens up


02:14:09.410  --> 02:14:14.260 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's something
my trembling hands seek to grasp


02:14:14.260  --> 02:14:16.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And that's all


02:14:16.100  --> 02:14:19.550 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Catching the scent of night


02:14:19.550  --> 02:14:23.020 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I glare at the sky


02:14:23.020  --> 02:14:28.470 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, the only thing I can change is myself


02:14:28.470  --> 02:14:30.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And that's all


02:14:30.410  --> 02:14:36.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now I know why I can be strong


02:14:36.880  --> 02:14:43.440 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take me with you and keep moving forward


02:14:43.440  --> 02:14:44.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No matter what


02:14:44.980  --> 02:14:48.240 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if dreams can't be erased
and the present is unstoppable


02:14:48.240  --> 02:14:52.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I can become stronger
for someone else


02:14:52.530  --> 02:14:57.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Then just rise up again and again


02:14:57.430  --> 02:15:02.530 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Overwhelmed by the world,
now I know what it means to lose


02:15:02.530  --> 02:15:06.760 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Crimson flowers bursting into bloom


02:15:06.760  --> 02:15:12.050 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Illuminating my destiny


02:15:17.080  --> 02:15:22.770 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won't be held captive by my grief


02:15:22.770  --> 02:15:31.930 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won't leave behind tears
wherever I look down


02:15:31.930  --> 02:15:35.280 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
By shaking off my fate


02:15:35.280  --> 02:15:38.340 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can start running


02:15:38.340  --> 02:15:41.220 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I know my wishes will come true


02:15:41.220  --> 02:15:44.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Crush the conflicts of yesterday


02:15:44.880  --> 02:15:49.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cry for the future
from the edge of darkness


02:15:49.990  --> 02:15:53.070 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seize control of the headwind


02:15:53.070  --> 02:15:57.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if you can't see past the storm


02:15:57.160  --> 02:16:01.520 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There's no other path to choose
So survive


02:16:01.520  --> 02:16:09.300 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It'll always be love versus rage
when you find yourself wavering


02:16:09.300  --> 02:16:16.800 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's time to get on your feet one more time


02:16:16.800  --> 02:16:24.150 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And now, with that blade


02:16:24.150  --> 02:16:29.880 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where will you strike?


02:16:45.340  --> 02:16:49.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Lower Five was really strong.


02:16:50.930  --> 02:16:54.100 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And Tomioka could defeat him
with only one blow.


02:16:54.100  --> 02:16:58.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are all Hashiras as strong as Tomioka?


02:17:00.420  --> 02:17:04.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
By the way, Nezuko, what should we talk
about in today's preview?


02:17:04.110  --> 02:17:06.110 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's obvious!


02:17:06.110  --> 02:17:08.990 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We should talk about this movie!


02:17:08.990  --> 02:17:11.680 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You must hop on the train with me!


02:17:11.680  --> 02:17:13.190 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
O-Okay...


02:17:13.190  --> 02:17:14.780 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Our mission is...!


02:17:14.780  --> 02:17:18.690 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Before that, time for a Taisho-era secret.


02:17:18.690  --> 02:17:22.879 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Rengoku's favorite bento dish
is salted grilled sea bream.


02:17:22.879  --> 02:17:26.299 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And, for the rice is sweet potato rice.


02:17:26.299  --> 02:17:29.059 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tanjiro, these sweet potatoes
are freshly steamed!


02:17:29.059  --> 02:17:31.090 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Already hot steamed, Gonpachiro!


02:17:31.090  --> 02:17:32.430 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Satsuma's sweet potatoes, am I right?


02:17:32.430  --> 02:17:34.709 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here you go.
Still hot.


02:17:34.709  --> 02:17:36.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thank you, I'll take one.


02:17:42.139  --> 02:17:43.730 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wasshoi!


02:17:45.990  --> 02:17:47.980 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wasshoi! Wasshoi!


02:17:48.820  --> 02:17:51.799 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Guys, don't forget to watch our movie!


02:17:52.580  --> 02:17:54.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Comin' through!


02:17:54.750  --> 02:17:57.180 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll protect Nezuko!


02:17:58.120  --> 02:18:01.139 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's say goodbye to the audience


02:18:01.139  --> 02:18:03.400 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and we shall meet again in the theater!
